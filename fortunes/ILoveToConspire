Drama always beats facts, people don’t like feedback,
they want answers that equate to their current mental state,
and if you reassure their fears, and wipe away all of their tears,
and bring them hope, give them love, claim you’re sent from up above,
but if a little seed of doubt is planted then you’d want it out,
before it poisons and destroys obedient young girls and boys,
so if you make a little peep, to the farmers, to the sheep,
I’ll sneak into your quarters and I’ll cut you in your fucking sleep!
