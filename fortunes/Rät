I come from scientists and atheists and white men who kill God
%
They make technology high quality, complex, physiological
%
Experiments and sacrilege in the name of public good
%
They taught me everything, just like a daddy should
%
And you were beautiful and vulnerable and power and success
%
God damn, I fell for you, your flamethrowers, your tunnels, and your tech
%
I studied code because I wanted to do something great like you
And the real tragеdy is half of it was true
%
But we've been fuckin' mеan, we're elitist, we're as flawed as any church
%
And this faux-rad West coast dogma has a higher fuckin' net worth
%
I bit the apple 'cause I trusted you, it tastes like Thomas Malthus
%
Your proposal is immodest and insane
%
And I hope someday Selmers rides her fuckin' train
%
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, it's true
I wanted to be you and do what you do
I lived here, I loved here, I thought it was true
I feel so stupid, and so used
%
I feel so used
%
I was your baby, your firstborn, the hot girl in your comp-sci class
%
And I was Darwin's prep school dream, bred, born and raised to kick your ass
%
I fell for circuit boards, rocket ships, pictures of the stars
%
If you could only be what you pretend you are
%
When I said take me to the moon, I never meant take me alone
%
I thought if mankind toured the sky, it meant that all of us could go
But I don't want to see the stars if they're just one more piece of land
For us to colonize, for us to turn to sand
%
%'Cause we're so fuckin' mean, we're so elitist, we're as fucked as any church
%
And this bullshit West coast dogma has a higher fuckin' net worth
%
I bit the apple 'cause I loved you, and why would you lie?
%
And then I realized that you're just as naïve as I am
%
Oh, you're so traumatized it makes me want to cry
%
You dumb bitch
%
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, it's true
I wanted to be you and do what you do
I lived here, I loved here, I bought it, it's true
I'm so embarrassed, I feel abused
%
Well, I don't want to eat the rich, I'd have to eat my heroes first
%
And my tuition's paid by blood, I might deserve your fate or worse
%
But, I don't need your god damn money, I don't need jack shit from you
%
So when I speak, you bet your life my words are true
%
Let me level with you, man, as someone guilty of the game
%
I took the help, I took the cash, I would've taken your last name
%
So if any girl on Earth should get to make a call about this
It should be me, and as I see it, you're a dick
%
So fuck your tunnels, fuck your cars, fuck your rockets, fuck your cars again
%
You promised you'd be Tesla, but you're just another Edison
%
'Cause Tesla broke a patent, all you ever broke were hearts
%
I can't believe you tore humanity apart
With the very same machines that could have been our brand new start
%
And the worst part is
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, it's true
And sometimes I feel like I still fuckin' do
I lived here, I loved here, I bought it, it's true
I'm so embarrassed, I feel abused
%
I feel so used
%
I feel so used
%
Take me to the moon
%
'Cause I feel so used
%
I feel so used
%
