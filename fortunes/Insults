Buttons are for idiots.
%
You are very confused.
%
Have you considered trying to live 100% without our software?
%
Your grief would seem more sincere if didn't look like a shopping list.
%
You are not listening.
%
You enabled things which are disabled for a good reason.
%
It is pretty clear you are a troll.
%
No, please, don't explain.
%
You obviously have zero experience.
%
You clearly cannot read.
%
You better get back to class; your potty break is over.
%
Go read the source code some time.
%
Nope.
%
No.
%
Bullshit.
%
I believe you deserve to stop running the software.
%
You are wrong.
%
Don't be ridiculous.
%
Your hopes are misplaced.
%
I still think you are a loser.
%
Holy cow, you are dense.
%
Totally false.
%
You must not be reading the same code I am.
%
Your approach is wrong.
%
What you just said was utterly careless.
%
No. You misread the code.
%
That is a simplistic viewpoint held by your simplistic mind.
%
I hope that one day due process is denied you.
%
Such an American viewpoint.
%
It didn't work out for Don Quixote either.
%
You have it entirely backwards.
%
But you decided you are special, and don't want us to help us help you.
%
Oh good grief, grow up.
%
Things change. Learn to cope.
%
Bye bye.
%
Stop thinking of only yourself.
%
You don't listen well either.
%
The comedy just never ends.
%
Hahahahaha. That's a good one.
%
I have a hard time believing you.
%
You are using FreeBSD, aren't you.
%
These programs are all bad.
%
If you want the answers you are looking for, do the work yourself.
%
That is not our problem.
%
If you are not careful, why should we be?
%
Enjoy your windmill tilting.
%
Oh, but linux people told you it was the best. I get it.
%
You already have a prompt that asks you that question.
%
We'll be waiting for your fix then.
%
Come on. Read it carefully.
%
It's a pity you don't go jump in a lake and drown yourself.
%
I don't see any humility.
%
What a load of bullshit.
%
You are killing us with hyperbole. It's hard to take anything you say seriously.
%
FULL STOP.
%
Why don't you figure that out.
%
Your usage case is "Give me a button to push".
%
Balony.
%
Anyways, who cares.
%
You're kidding.
%
You are making up rules as you go along. Why don't you go read the code?
%
Oh cut the crap.
%
Frankly, I think you are a whiner.
%
In your dreams..
%
No. You must be at least this tall to use OpenBSD; sorry -- you are a midget.
%
You've got it all wrong.
%
In summary -- the entire effort is a complete load of crap.
%
Oh come on, admit it, you are wrong.
%
That's a lot of words.
%
Sorry, but I have lost all appetite to help you.
%
Oh sorry, I forgot to think like an American for a second there.
%
I'm not even going to read to the end.
%
You are a prick.
%
Tell linus. You can google for his email address.
%
Just pathetic. Hope you actually get a life sometime.
%
Wrong.
%
You missed the point.
%
You realize that you are going to run into thousands of other
problems as a result of that practice?
%
Really. How interesting.
%
Let's keep it simple. Why don't you just go away, and stop acting the fool?
%
I am just plain fed up with the bullshit you cowards spew.
%
Have you thought this through, at all?
%
Some days I want to just quit and say fuck it all.
%
Let idiots suffer on their own.
%
The point is that you are a crybaby.
%
We really are not interested in the story of your life.
%
So you presume.
%
Can you please leave?
%
Now, again, please leave.
%
Your attitude stinks. Good luck with life.
%
I don't see your name on any source code. So you shut up, loser. Just go away.
%
Perhaps we made mistakes.
Perhaps they'll be changed.
But you are just spouting bullshit.
%
I am not being sarcastic.  I truly am sick of having my time wasted.
%
Yes you are wrong, and damn infuriating too.
%
You need to learn how to listen.
%
Read what it says.
%
You just like listening to yourself talk. Shut up.
%
I don't see the point.
%
Please don't.
%
The best part is that noone cares about that.
%
It is disgraceful to see what type of code being written these days.
%
If you don't like it, run something else.
%
I don't care.
%
I don't give a shit.
%
I really don't give a shit what you admire or not.
%
Your sense of self-importance just makes other people not even want to try.
%
I could not give a rats ass what you say.
%
You just plain don't understand the problem.
%
Your attitude is not very nice.
%
You had me going for a moment.
%
Wow, your process stinks.
%
You need to read more carefully.
%
If you are just grandstanding, please stop.
%
Ah, we have another talker in the house.
%
You'll never be a developer, so who cares?
%
Just give it up and get lost.
%
Wow, you sure like to make presumptions.
%
Thing is, you won't get help here.
%
Your lack of any attempt to educate yourself is your problem.
%
No, no no no no.
%
No. You have it wrong. Go back to reading school.
%
Come on.. stop making assumptions.
%
We are not believers in buttons.  Knobs are for knobs.
%
Oh yeah, that's a great idea!
%
I'm making fun of you.
%
Whatever you did does not do what you think it does.
In fact, I bet it is doing exactly the opposite of what you think it does.
%
Don't be fooled.
%
They are simplistic retards, not because they choose to be, but
because their paychecks tell them to be so.
%
Great.
%
Oh, you're not going to do it?  Oh you can't do it?
%
No way.
%
Except you are wrong.
%
You guys just are not thinking.
%
You've got to be kidding me.
%
I won't look further since you have a history of not listening.
%
Are you a troll?
%
can you not read the prompt?
%
you could try "make me sandwich" and have the same effect.
%
No, I am advocating that you TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN PROBLEMS YOURSELF.
%
Who's the child now?
%
So learn to type correctly.
%
Shame on you.
%
This is an error in the manual page.
%
whatever.
%
I do not agree with your assessment.
%
Geez, you're not listening
%
make of it what you will.
%
Unfortunate.
%
Be realistic.
%
Sorry, but you are wrong.
%
You are completely missing the point.
%
If that workaround was the right thing to do, it would be the default.
%
You are just a whiny boy who pisses on people who spent years writing the code.
%
In short, you are socially inept unappreciative asshole.
%
Come on guys.  Don't have me OK this.
%
I see other projects falling into this problem all the time. It is awesome.
%
Ha ha. I watch other projects.
%
We won't commit it.
%
Perhaps.
%
I don't see any problem.
%
As developers we make decisions which we believe serve our users the best.
%
Wow, what's that got to do with anything?
%
You have this very wrong.
%
Your code is completely wrong.
%
No way.
%
None of that matters here.
%
I am not directing you.
%
Wow.  You sure do set the bar low.
%
The rest of what you are yapping about does not matter.
%
Do you think we care?
%
God bless the people who employ you, they need the blessing.
%
That's the process.
%
Hey, stick a screw driver into your ear.
%
Does it help anything?  No.
%
Ridiculous.
%
You know better.
%
Beautiful.
%
Good luck!
%
Totally wrong there.
%
Uhm, that's a pretty weak argument.
%
Too bad. You can use other software.
%
I decided to make a guess as to the region you are from.
%
Your request is ridiculous.
%
The people who write code get to decide how they document it.
%
Don't like it?  Then walk away.
%
The only person who did something useful, is the author of the software.
%
There is a user community, and a development community.
%
Listen to yourself, proud of the complex words you found in a dictionary.
%
It is really amazing that so many people prefer to remain blissfully unaware.
%
Sorry, but it's the truth.
%
So glad to have the expert speak.
%
It is an obvious mechanism.
%
Good luck.
%
That's a great idea.
%
That is not true.
%
Maybe.
%
It's so simple.  Why didn't I think of it.
%
If you want it done, do it yourself.
%
I rather doubt it.
%
You've missed the point.
%
Wow, so many crazy suggestions.
%
I completely doubt that.
%
thanks for the lesson in logic.
%
Please state your case very carefully and clearly.
%
Right now, you are not talking facts.
%
You are spreading misinformation.
%
Why???
%
NO WAY!
%
That feels like a disservice to the world.
%
Bullshit.
%
Wow. What hostility.
%
From time to time, mistakes sneak in.
%
What is your solution?
%
And what is your solution?
%
I'm getting ready to declare you a kook
%
In that situation, you would probably want to be left in peace.
%
You seem to have a rather over-extended sense of entitlement
%
You are speaking like a child.
%
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARITY.
%
Sigh.
%
People like you...
%
Let's follow that thought.
%
Incorrect.
%
I don't see the point.
%
Take that for what it is.
%
Whatever you're doing, it is wrong.
%
Riiiiiiiiight. Suuuuuuuure. Keep believing that.
%
I would like to see some proof of that.
%
That's not going to happen.
%
Wow. No.
%
Unlikely.
%
Well...
%
That is a very dangerous direction.
%
I think this will cause further damage.
%
Wow, really thick skull you got there.
%
Get real.
%
And then we move on?
%
Are you kidding? Who does that help? Who?
%
You have offered nothing.
%
You overstate your worth.
%
shrug
%
In your dreams.
%
Amazing isn't it?
%
Oh now I sense some angst.
%
See how bad things start to happen?
%
But I think it is clear you aren't a programmer, and this is over your head.
%
Did they pay you to write all that text?
%
there is bullshit coming out of your mouth.
%
The nastiest behaviour is "sense of entitlement".
%
You are the type of people who create these situations.
%
We rarely hear about success, because those people are just happy.
%
Totally irrelevant.
%
It is what it is. Work with it.
%
I'm trying to stay out of politics.
%
there are fingers to point all the way around.
%
am i making all this up? perhaps i am, but you don't have to dream my dreams.
%
I was up at 9am, climbed a mountain, hiked 6 km through 4ft deep
slush (the image you are supposed to get is of 12 million overturned
slurpee cups, and of getting your groin wet in slurpee), nearly died
eating beef vindaloo, wrote some code, talked on the phone, wrote
mail, and now it's almost 4am and this is absolutely beyond ridiculous.
%
who said that?
%
why are you asking me?
%
Then I guess you are just stupid.
%
Since you don't supply diffs, you are a waste of skin.
%
Huh?  You've understood incorrectly.
%
This approach is simplistic and wrong.
%
What problem are you trying to solve?
%
Wow, what chatter.
%
There are people who do that.
%
Shrug.
%
Chill dude.
%
It is crap.
%
I don't know you, maybe I am misinterpreting you.
%
Wow, don't know where you got that from.
%
You persist in reading too much into things.
%
So this is a great way to lose focus.
%
You can figure out what I'm not saying on this line.
%
I think this is a trap.
%
That is an interesting claim.
%
ANSWER THE QUESTION.
%
I am not playing any games.  Let's look at the facts.
%
I haven't even read this.
%
I don't care.
%
I quite dislike the direction this is going.
%
Nothing ever changes, noone ever learns, noone cares.
%
With your attitude, I beg you to please go run some other operating
system.
%
Why haven't you left? Please leave.
%
Please leave immediately.
%
Get over it.
%
Please read the actual code.
%
Was that necessary?
%
Handholding can go only so far.
%
Please, not again.
%
It is in the FAQ.
%
Someone is totally full of shit.
%
You are quite a character.
%
You have an agenda.
%
So easy to be critical.
%
Great conversation...
%
Who do you work for? Governments?
%
Please people, ignore him.
%
I love this conversation.
%
Amazing.
%
Go a few cycles.
%
Why?
%
No really, precisely why do you trust us?
%
What a joke.
%
That is quite a fiction.
%
Never expect a group to perform a task which an individual won't.
%
We never said our code should be trusted.
%
Since I value my sanity, I saw that, and I ignored it.
%
The complaint department is down the hall.
%
Such strong words.
%
It must be easy to sit in your chair and demand that others meet your expectations.
%
Didn't you read the manual page?
%
I think you are on your own.
%
Nope.
%
Look there is a disconnect.
%
Hilarious.
%
And now let's ask the question which matters.
%
Did you think of that?
%
You aren't even trying.  PLONK.
%
Oh just shut up.
%
You aren't going to do shit because you don't have any skills.
%
Thank you for adding the value of your words.
%
Welcome to the real world.
%
Sorry.
%
Look, this is rather simple.
%
Oh really.
%
It ends badly.
%
I explained that.
%
Alas.
%
Guess you don't understand internet.
%
Can I ask what kind of plant are you?
%
And who are you, and what you have you done to test and then prove your thesis?
%
I am continually baffled by how often we have to explain this point,
over and over and over again.
%
Do not submit a new bug report.
%
Nope!
%
Sigh.
%
Now you plainly don't sound like a developer type.
%
What is your solution?
%
You've got access to all this source code.
%
If you can't study the world around you, you will remain ignorant.
%
Don't worry.
%
Is that an accusation?
%
Look, you'll be fine.
%
I've think you've had your say.
%
You've had your say.
%
Do you get it?  I doubt it.
%
How dreary.
%
Anyways, your timing is atrocious!
%
Look, stop being a child.
%
Such hyperbole!  Such drama!
%
Reactive is not the same as proactive.
%
I'll ask in a general fashion: Are you stupid?
%
You are out of touch.
%
Are you going to do something -- beyond just being sarcastic?
%
Highly unlikely.
%
Better question is: Why?
%
Get back onto your meds.
%
What a waste of words.
%
Please people stop mailing me privately and asking.
%
Wait and see.
%
In general, you underestimate the effort involved.
%
Well, I don't think the world will fall over as a result.
%
NOT....
%
I think this entire conversation is ridiculous, right from the start.
%
I do not agree with those assessments.
%
In that case, what's the fuss?
%
Well....
%
I disagree on all those points.
%
Completely wrong, and I have no idea where you got that from!
%
Read the man page again!
%
You are scaring me.
%
I believe something is not being understood here.
%
I don't normally do this.
%
Well sorry.
%
I don't see any reason.
%
Oh something is broken?
%
Please show your work.
%
Let's get serious and personal here for a second.  In other aspects
of life, do you behave the same?
%
That is kind of crazy, isn't it.
%
That is an incorrect assessment.
%
That is only the beginning of it.
%
This is more than a meme. It is a plot.
%
Boggles the mind.
%
Please.
%
You know that is bullshit right?
%
Please stop subscribing us to your motivations.
%
That is false.
%
You are speaking in riddles.
%
That's nice.
%
You are so full of BS!
%
You are quite a persistent idiot.
%
You don't know jack shit about computers or electronics, that much is obvious.
%
Once again you show that you don't know shit.
%
You are on your own.
%
you have confused yourself.
%
You've been smoking something really mind altering, I think you should share it.
%
People should be careful what they ask for
%
Aww come on, you had us going until then.
%
I think I hear of someone doing this about every 10 years.
%
I made none of the claims you are composing.
%
That makes no sense.
%
Cannot.
%
Your process here is really strange.
%
How bizarre.
%
This conversation is going far too meta.
%
What's the goal.
%
What you are trying to do is insane, wrong, and entirely unsupported.
%
SERIOUSLY??
%
There are too few of us, we cannot take on every problem.
%
Everyone, please ignore these trolls who are cross-posting.
%
Essentially, you are on your own. :-)
%
I am not so sure.
%
obviously.
%
I don't know, but I'll think about it later, because I am busy.
%
Thanks.
%
Careful there :-)
%
Your mistake.
%
what is "this case"?
%
my advice: walk away from this one.
%
So what do you really mean here?
%
what is the goal?
%
Your emails only contain opinions.
%
words words words words
%
Are you done?
%
Doesn't that send shivers down your spine?
%
No.
%
We'd rather jump off a cliff.
%
Good luck with that.
%
Looking forward to you providing code which solves the problem.
%
This feature is probably older than you.
%
it is behaving *exactly* as intended.
%
There are a few compromises.
%
I think I know a perfect candidate to take this further: You.
%
Seriously?
%
Hey, it looks like you are just trying to be a dick.
%
Does your mother know?
%
It's great that you have an opinion.
%
Run something else! We don't care!
%
That's a load of bull.
%
Your opinions count for zero.
%
To achieve merit, you must do the homework you assigned yourself.
%
Get serious.
%
and I wanna build a rocket ship...
%
No thanks.
%
The problem is obvious.
%
If you don't have the skill to do it, well that's too bad...
%
I tried to read the rest of what you wrote. It makes no sense.
%
I find this discussion pretty uninteresting.
%
I wish more people would find real bugs to fix.
%
I'm done.
%
I don't think you understand what is being done here.
%
Funny.
%
I don't see that.
%
I don't have an answer for you.
%
I don't see the purpose of that.
%
No.
%
Doctor it hurts when I stab myself in the eye.
%
I believe you are not trying to contribute anything valuable with
your comment.
%
are you being trolled now?
%
You are not tall enough to ride.
%
^^^^^^^
%
People who submit reports which are missing information should feel terrible.
%
Absolutely no way, that makes no sense.
%
Kill it.
%
On that matter, I'd say tough.
%
It's not black magic.
%
Sigh.
%
Disagree strongly.
%
Don't hold me responsible for the shortcuts.
%
And noone cares what you like or dislike.
%
There will be little or no thought.
%
I am very sceptical.
%
A related issue is lots of people don't know anything about anything.
%
Look, your statement is false.
%
That is the result of a mis-configuration on your part.
%
That is not best practice.
%
This does not matter.
%
It is risk, all gigantic risk.
%
Sometimes people put a bad idea into an RFC.
%
Why -- to hurt people?
%
Oh the situation is much worse than that.
%
I disagree.
%
The same model is not applicable to everything.
%
This is another offer which will be rejected.
%
No.
%
Tired of the suggestions.
%
The end.
%
Sorry, I see it the other way around.
%
This is how rumours start, I guess.
%
That is incorrect.
%
That is the worst possible advice ever.
%
I am really impressed by the analytical skills I observe here.
%
Maybe the fortress fell over because you didn't have enough Lego.
%
Why are you doing this?
%
I still don't see the use case.
%
You haven't justified it.
%
No.
%
I have changed my mind.
%
Whoa.
%
I don't see how that helps anything.
%
What do you want us to do about it?
%
I think you are done here.
%
Whoah.
%
because.
%
No, it is not.
%
Why?
%
Please supply a good justification why that is good.
%
End of story.
%
Everyone tires of your well articulated agenda pushes.
%
Incorrect.
%
Not exactly.
%
Our function in this ecosystem definitely does not include dealing
with other people's bullshit decisions...
%
If you don't care, then don't talk about it.
%
Your voice does not count.
%
that is really not a useful bug report.
%
Yeah, you sure are the cool dude.
%
Things change.
%
Whoa.
%
No?
%
Expectation management is a bitch.
%
There has been a lot of discussion about this.
%
Just stop it. We are not going to listen to you.
%
That is not right.
%
You are on your own.
%
That is not true.
%
That's nice.
%
not everything is perfect.
%
I don't like it.
%
We prefer creating a world that is simpler.
%
Are we finished here?
%
that is intentional.
%
Why not delete it?
%
Pick a position -- then defend it.
%
Switch to Linux, where violations are the norm.
%
Pick a damn position, and declare it.
%
If software sucks, say so.
%
Who didn't solve that problem?  People like you.
%
Around here, you come off like a dick who didn't help everyone.
%
Unfeasible!
%
There is no juxtaposition.
%
AND WHERE IS THE PONY.
%
It's ok, my cats cannot read and interpret such complexities either.
%
You bought some plastic.
%
You sir, are just wastewater.
%
Your words are just bile.
%
You are way out of line with the software development community.
%
Your interpretations are hostile.
%
I could be doing far better things than making CDs.
%
No way.
%
You are more likely to get sympathy from your mother.
%
[rest deleted]
%
if you can't use the tools to study what is happening, you don't
stand a chance making things better
%
No thanks, it does not make sense.
%
No, you should not.
%
We do not have magic to do this at the moment.
%
Well, openbsd is not linux.
%
This is likely to change, in some way.
%
Thanks for the feedback :-)
%
No, it is not.
%
Why?
%
Please supply a good justification why that is good.
%
End of story.
%
Everyone tires of your well articulated agenda pushes.
%
Incorrect.
%
Not exactly.
%
We already suffer from low quality in many bug reports.
%
Our function in this ecosystem definitely does not include dealing
with other people's bullshit decisions...

Thanks for the feedback :-)
%
you will only receive crocodile tears from me.
%
Well perhaps you should just leave if you don't like the truth?
%
It is all about your actions.
%
Survival in the universe requires more than copy-and-paste.
%
Summary: The OP has a learning disability.
%
Frankly, who cares?
%
Get off my computer kidz.
%
That stands against my principles.
%
Take a chill pill, or participate in improving it, or wait your
turn.
%
When things go wrong, we contain their influence.
%
sorry to hear you don't understand
%
this is not really a forum to attempt education
%
Look -- did you read the manual page?
%
It seems you did all that, but didn't read the manual pages.
%
Not all errata are for security.
%
Uneducated *check* opinionated *check*
%
There is no way to forgive people who intentionally step in the shit.
%
It sounds as if you don't understand what happens.
%
So what is learned here?
%
I don't have an answer.
%
Let me get this straight.
%
I see your character...
%
You can do whatever you want.
%
That is completely insane.
%
Crazy.
%
Please.
%
I really doubt the drama of this.
%
whatever
%
Look.
%
Well, is mentioning this even important?
%
I'll ask the question: Why are you sure you need that?
%
pretty sad, but I guess that's the way the world works
%
There is a bug in your brain.
%
You yammer yammer yammer without detail.
%
Something is eating your brain.
%
It depends on what you want.
%
They are manual pages, not manual books.
%
You are welcome to spend your time building an entire new subsystem
and proving the value of your work.
%
Go knock yourself out.
%
Sorry you lost me.
%
I can't tell if you are supporting a useless idea, or declaring
that a useless idea is not worth supporting.
%
So lets just yak about it, right?
%
Yes, I said asshole.
%
I'm astounded by this situation.
%
It is hard to believe people will want that.
%
Why the surprise?
%
Basically, this cannot be oversimplified by 1 line questions followed
by 1 line answers.
%
I'm sorry, but I don't get it.
%
Bootstrapping problem is bootstrapping problem.
%
That is not possible.
%
You really haven't got a clue.
%
You can go read the source.
%
That is incorrect.
%
We don't manage dependencies.
%
You haven't justified need.
%
Careful what you ask for.
%
Demands aren't well received.
%
A detailed bug report helps. 1 line of whining doesn't.
%
4. Roll up sleeves and fix the issue.
%
If you don't understand how computers and networking work, I'm sure
you can find another job.
%
Not everyone is suited to every role.
%
Another solution is to smash that device with a hammer.
%
Did that help?
%
Some of you will think this is a total joke.
%
Overdocumenting isn't a strength.
%
If you want it working, you will need to get it fixed.
%
If you really wanted it fixed you have the src code.
%
Please leave here.
%
Just you, I think.
%
That won't work.
%
If I see a mail which isn't plain text, I delete it.
%
only thinking of yourself, and missing the point.
%
No, what you want does not exist.
%
I said no the first time, and provided a detailed explanation.
%
Why did you feel the need jump in? Itchy butt?
%
Let's just stop this.
%
You just aren't capable of listening to what is being said.
%
I'd like my lawn mowed.
%
I think the entire approach is dumb.
%
There was once a better path.
%
Animated sparkle.
%
I'm not sure what else you expect.
%
Punting stupid problems along forever just gets worse and worse.
%
In a decade, what will this mess look like?
%
When people push buttons, they will eventually hit something
undocumented.
%
I just came to the conclusion you are a loud-mouthed jackass.
%
So go away.
%
That doesn't make sense.
%
Well the options are: Get involved and do the work, or watch.
%
There is no policy.
%
Twice the work == twice the work.
%
Unfortunately, you cannot really help.
%
Learn the magic, change the magic.
%
Oh, so you are just some bossy guy on the net
%
You own all the pieces.
%
You are wrong.
%
No way.
%
You are showing inexperience.
%
No, not really.
%
Basically you are saying we should just change everything, consequences
and correctness be damned.
%
Uhm, in your dreams.
%
Not everything in unix is perfect.
%
That sucks.
%
That is working as intended.
%
trace or it didn't happen.
%
The solution is obvious.
%
By the way who are you?
%
You come off as pretty uncharitable.
%
More complexity.
%
I don't think you are listening.
%
Shrug.
%
I discussed world peace in a bar once.
%
Lots of words. No action.
%
Or you can go it all yourself.  Why don't you do that?
%
But we don't need to put up with your demands.
%
Adjust your attitude user
%
I believe this conversation is over, because you have no credibility.
%
Oh are you just talking?
%
Inventing crazy shit is pointless.
%
Lots of misunderstandings in there.
%
Then it is probably over your head. Not much I can do about that.
%
That interpretation is wrong.
%
Don't change my words.
%
It is over your head. Or learn to read. Or learn to not reply before you think.
%
You have a self-entitlement issue.
%
IF YOU ARE A GIGANTIC SLOPPY FAT PIG YOU SURE DO
%
Please go fluff up your sense of self-worth elsewhere.
%
There are no workarounds.
%
You been running that on the internet?
%
That'd be like leaving a running chainsaw on the floor at a daycare center.
%
When something is dangerous, we get rid of it.
%
Oh, cut your crap.
%
So fix it, or pay someone to fix it.
%
Oh the righteous indignation of public discussion!
%
Have you ever heard of the concept of helping yourself?
%
Don't believe all the promises you hear.
%
Unfortunately noone cares.
%
not that it matters.
%
I hope noone helps you.
%
You are not helping out.
%
You are doing the bare minimum and tapping on a keyboard.
%
The socket layer will conspire against you.
%
so much drama
%
Your process will not solve anything.
%
But this isn't a pony shop.
%
Shut up
%
It is documented.
%
Sorry, your interpretation is incorrect.
%
Do we want the 1% solution? No.
%
I disagree
%
And please stop using that word.
%
I doubt anyone believes your extremely vague assertions.
%
Who cares?
%
You are making stuff up.
%
I don't think so.
%
Why?
%
Are we done here?
%
You can search for the rest of the information yourself.
%
No.
%
Not going to explain further.
%
Get your shit together
%
oh my, the moral outrage
%
Let it go, and consider leaving for good.
%
Do you have evidence?
%
Diffs are welcome.
%
Please don't do that.
%
Thou'rt by no means valiant; for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm.
%
Thou errant earth-vexing bugbear!
%
Thou art a dull and muddy-mettled rascal.
%
Thy wit is a very bitter sweet, it is a most sharp sauce.
%
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
%
Thou fusty bat-fowling jolt-head!
%
Thou dankish toad-spotted harpy!
%
Thou sanguine coward!
%
Thou bed-presser!
%
Thou horseback-breaker
%
Thou huge hill of flesh!
%
Thou saucy pox-marked mammet!
%
Thy tongue out venoms all the worms of Nile.
%
Thou poisonous bunch-back'd toad!
%
Were I like thee I'd throw away myself.
%
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
%
Thou art not noble; for all th' accommodations that thou bear'st are nurs'd by baseness.
%
Thou art not so big as a round little worm.
%
Thou goatish hell-hated varlot!
%
Thou art a flesh monger, a fool, and a coward.
%
Would thou were clean enough to spit upon!
%
Thou art only mark'd for hot vengeance and the rod of heaven.
%
Thou craven guts-griping mumble-news!
%
Your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese.
%
Thou roguish dog hearted strumpet!
%
Thou art a fool, a coward, one all of luxury, an ass, a madman.
%
Thou puking mammalian malcontent!
%
Thou jarring elf-skinned lewdster!
%
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit.
%
Thou crusty botch of nature!
%
Thou ruttish pottle-deep whey-face!
%
Thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders, that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off.
%
Thou mammering common-kissing moldwarp!
%
Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove, or most magnanimous mouse.
%
O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified.
%
Thou goatish half-faced puttock!
%
Thou whore son mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels.
%
What, you egg! Young fry of treachery!
%
Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose.
%
A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
%
I never knew so young a body with so old a head.
%
I scorn you, scurvy companion. What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away!
%
Thou currish folly-fallen malt-worm!
%
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen as you are toss'd with.
%
Thou impertinent fly-bitten flap-dragon!
%
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth.
%
Thou wayward common-kissing hedge-pig!
%
Were I like thee I'd throw away myself.
%
Thou blubbering clay-brained bum-bailey!
%
I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables.
%
Thou art so leaky that we must leave thee to thy sinking.
%
Why thou globe of sinful continents, what a life dost thou lead!
%
What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way!
%
You are a shallow cowardly hind, and you lie.
%
Thou mewling ill-nurtured measle!
%
Thou clouted hasty-witted foot-licker!
%
Out of my sight! Thou dost infect my eyes.
%
Most shallow man! Thou worms-meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed!
%
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold.
%
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, start up and stand on end.
%
Thou bawdy pox-marked jolt-head!
%
