SHIP'S LOG 30 NOV


Woke up to the good news that maybe we would not have to wrestle with the IMS switchover until after the 4A mission. All onboard agree with the plan to keep things as they are for now. Really no big hit to us--we are logging things by hand and can continue to do this for the 4A gear transfers.

More good news--early entry into the Node to get gear. The troops are happy.

Sergei and Yuri start the workday with the rest of the procedure to charge the fluid loop on the ??? -1 thermal system.

Based on the word that we can only send down 5 'middeck locker-equivalents", Shep is in Progress stowing CTB's which can not be accommodated in the Shuttle for return. Discussions with Houston about stowage, gear return, CTB's all morning. We have to finish with Progress by mid afternoon and close it up.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 10 lines]

Sergei and Yuri spend the afternoon securing gear in Progress, making close-out photos, and testing comm from the ?? in FGB. Sergei's prepping the laser rangefinder for some more testing during undocking.

Shep gets later word that Shuttle will attempt to take down more bags. We're back in the Progress to pull out the CTB's we can get at readily.

We take on a bunch of O2 from Progress on the station--gauge says 785 mm (over C&W limit) for cabin pressure, and ground says PPO2 is now 190mm. Yuri and Sergei close the hatch. Ground runs a pressure check--SM hatch is OK, ground says Progress is also OK. We are wondering if we will see the inside of this Progress again.

Yuri does his EVA check on the velo with instrumentation. Shep on the TVIS. We are appreciating the 2-a-day workout plan. Sometimes we have to bend the workout times, but at least everyone is getting at the bike and the treadmill for 2 sessions each day.

Shep putting together the changes to the Joint Ops book for 4A. Big thanks to the planners for carving out some time to do this. It's the little things that really slow you down--like when you need a hole punch, and can't find one.


Finished the day with a comm pass with ??? and Houston. Passed on our best to the STS 97 crew for a good launch so they can get on up here.

0723 First comm pass with ???. Discussion with Houston on ??? about yesterday's TEPC comm issues. Also made a request for a "volume" estimate of how many CTB equivalents 4A can take home. We are going to take all foam out of the CTB's we want to return and put this material in Progress. Still will be the case that CTB's will likely have to be discarded because we have too much volume to give Shuttle. We are thinking to send as much on Shuttle as possible so that if we get Progress back, we can have max. stowage volume for the 4A-5A period. Logs planning needs to help us stay ahead of this one.

Shep's Execute package on SSC 2 client has all broken "links". Same with "onboard messages" page in the browser.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 8 lines]

Shep started prepping CTB's for transfer to Shuttle. We are getting 2 each "triple" CTB's stuffed with 8-10 other empty CTB's for return. This in addition to 2 CWC's, and about 6 flat metal food containers will be sent down. Other things we plan on returning include--film, video cassettes, air sample bottles, FMK samples, TVIS pc cards (that we can't get to work). This all will fit in a "double" CTB. We need ground's OK and suggestions for anything else we should ship home.

Sergei and Yuri do the photo documentation of the FGB nadir docking cone.

Sergei and Yuri change out the dust filters on FGB and SM, and put ???-? 5 in the Progress. We are still averaging 5 days per tank.

Crew did a "Challenger Center" PAO event on OCA. Help from CAPCOM and PAO was a big factor in making this easy for us. Performance of OCA was good.

Test of the television system for ?????? worked OK. TV image was clearer than on the Progress docking. We are assuming that Progress camera may be warmer and the previous ice or frost is not present.

1330 Sergei and Yuri working in the afternoon to put in the pump unit (3???) for the second thermal loop. Panels 247 and 248 are off of the SM aft during the installation. Loop #2 Pump package is putting out a pretty good high pitched whine. Loop #1 to be tested tomorrow.

Shep on velo. Warming it up for Sergei. Sergei does an EVA-related check on the velo ergometer. Yuri is helping with data and the medical gear.
Ground inquires whether we can relocate "Reflotron" medical equipment on SM panel 336 for permanent stowage. We are pondering the reason for this request.

Yuri and then Shep on the TVIS. Performance OK. Heart rate watch is a bit erratic--will not read the halter in certain orientations. We are taking the TVIS up to 12-14 km/hour for brief periods. Treadmill handles it without any noticeable problems.

More TV downlink to Moscow for media event. Sony DV cam keeps dropping its video out as we set it up in "standby". This is annoying--might be better just to use the tape and let it record continuously.

Sergei finishes the day with a prep for downlink of IMS delta file. He has also made a full backup of the database in case we lose something.

0648 On comm with ???. The usual "how's it going". Pressure check from manometer. The station seems very tight from a pressure integrity standpoint.

0755 OCA downlink for PAO. The crew did short spots for the Army-Navy game on Sat. Voice quality much better on our end than it has been since the flight began. PAO said downlink product had good quality.

0815 Sergei and Yuri working on loading the Progress. Putting soft bags and trash in the vehicle.

Shep starting CSA-CP calibration procedure. Primary unit (#1001) looks OK. Comparison data from backup analyzer does not look good. Several parameters reading "minus" values. Waiting to talk to the ground. Put the backup unit back in the bag and logged primary CSA-CP in MEC. Comments added about calibration difficulties.

Shep on velo, Sergei on TVIS.

Inspected ???? separator outlet on ???? and found it was dry--performing as expected.

Shep moved TEPC to panel 339 in the aft part of SM to do the TEPC data transfer to the Med computer. The MEC was unable to talk to the TEPC over its RS 232 data line. TEPC had power, MEC looked nominal, and the MEC has previously communicated with the CSA-CP and the polar watch on this port. Retried the serial bus line per procedure about 4-5 more times and stopped. Talked to ??? and Houston regarding the details. TEPC powered off and located on SM 428.
Hopefully, this will be an acceptable survey location for the next period of TEPC measurements. We are becoming somewhat constrained as to where we can conveniently put TEPC, as many of the CHECS ports are being used to power SSC's and the printer. We have 2 of the 6 CHECS outlets "free" at the moment.

Yuri checked out the veloergometer telemetry line with the ground.

1450 Ground had the crew hook up cables to check telemetry on connections for the 2nd airconditioning unit ???-2., Inadvertently, one of the blowers which draws air through the heat exchanger started operating. We heard vibrations and metallic sounds, and then smelled a bit of hot insulation. Ground called that the fan was off. Visual inspection revealed at least one blade sheared off the fan (small axial vanes) and jammed up in the blade housing. Will have to wait until we can take this apart to see more details. We're guessing that something hard went through the blades, but we will have to see the whole unit. The good news is that we show a spare blower onboard, so we have another chance to go fix something.

Right after the blower episode, we had the "Discovery Channel" PAO event. OCA performance was consistently good. Downlink lasted over 20 minutes. When the interviewer asked us if we had had any difficulties on startup of all the station systems, the airconditioning unit gave us some new and interesting things to talk about.

Rest of the afternoon included more gear stowage, and then gym time at about 16:30. TVIS performance good. Velo also.

SHIP'S LOG 27 NOV


We're up--first comm with TsUP at 0614. Breakfast in the "wardroom"--on our mess table. The crew "turned to" over the weekend and we have a prototype table set up with brackets and clamps to evaluate size and location. All hands agree that the standard table (still on the ground) will not be very serviceable, as it will block access to the SRVK, and will be in the way of the treadmill and the doorway of the starboard cayuta. Our do-it-yourself model is somewhat narrower, shorter and lower. We think our prototype will fit better, and we feel pretty happy that we can leave the other table on the ground. Power tools are out and development activity on the prototype continues as we find time.

0730 First work starts. Yuri is filling the flush water tank for the ACY system by hose and pump from SVO system. Sergei starts installing the BITS memory module in the overhead of SM small diameter. Shep stowing computer gear, disks, CD's and other hardware which was used last week for MEC activation and software changes.

0900 All hands help in changing the inlet hose/filter assembly on ACY. We got 6 new hoses when Progress arrived--this should last us until maybe the third or fourth expedition.

Sergei notices that the Russian PCS laptop has locked up. He tries to reboot, but the Sun application software won't load. Lots of messages on the screen noting data errors. Sergei thinks that it may be the hard drive. He boots up windows to see if the windows partition runs OK--it does. So at least some of the hardware is functional. Troubleshooting starts right away with TsUP. Without this PCS, we don't have a laptop interface to the central post computers.

Yuri on velo.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 10 lines]

1130 SSC network time updated. SSC File server backup delayed until afternoon for file transfers with the ground. We would like to investigate whether the file server could back up to a PC card over the network--this would save us a bit of hardware reconfiguration for the server.

Shep on velo then on TVIS. Did the monthly maintenance inspection on TVIS. Rubber "Series Bungee System" looked OK. All 3 crew are using one system--this speeds up the setup times. Would like to recommend that we come up with an easier way to remove the protective fabric "sock" and inspect these tubes. Maybe some kind of velcro to secure the fabric. Began normal exercise session.

Yuri and Sergei continue to load the "bilge" in Progress with leftover SFG boxes, KTO's. EDV's, and other dense items. The large metal containers at the bottom of the cargo compartment are about half full. We should be pretty well packed up in Progress after the workday tomorrow. We plan on returning 20+ CTB's with Shuttle when Endeavour departs. In anticipation of getting Progress back aboard after 4A departure, we would like to send bags with packing foam down with Endeavour. We were thinking about discarding the foam with Progress, but decided not to as this will give us more useful stowage in Progress through January.

1551 Yuri getting ready for velo and Sergei warming up TVIS. Got a master alarm and the red light for "other" (warning) on the caution and warning panel. We were thinking it was a bad time for an alarm with the Russian PCS down. We checked US PCS and saw the alarm source. A DDCU on Z1 looked to be having a 4A-related data configuration problem. Checked with Houston and confirmed no crew action.

Put some more O2 into the station from Progress--5 more mm.
Early evening--did an OCA test from the front room in Houston, and comm was good. Well improved over the previous weeks. Houston said the OCA machine had been swapped out. Voice quality much better, even video looked sharper. If OCA can hold that performance, then its' useablity to us will be way up.

More on OCA--the move. With the upcoming EVA's and the cable swaps, understand that we will lose the early comm exterior data line to the OCA in the FGB (and capability to drag OCA into SM). Having the OCA right at the central post is most convenient. We can hear the call connect "ring" anywhere in the SM, and this is a big advantage for us. Our ability to pay attention to the OCA will be significantly reduced once the machine is back in FGB or in the Node.

0640 First comm pass. Some changes to the OCA schedule for the day.

Breakfast and second comm pass. Sergei discusses some problems with the way windows is handling cyrillic fonts.

0858 Smoke sensor #10 in PRK activated for 10-15 seconds. Interesting response on PYS (pulyt ypravleniye signalom) ---sensors 1 thru 9 briefly lit as smoke sensor 10 was active (blinking). Did not expect to see this. System returned to normal status. We would like to ask for some "ground" help to better understand that this is a correct indication. Everything in PRK looks normal.

Shep, then Yuri on TVIS. Sergei on velo.

Sergei and Yuri doing some more stowage.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 8 lines]

Shep in Progress clearing out brackets and getting ready to bolt containers down. Gear needs to be well secured inside to avoid any disruption of the motion control system during undocking and possible redock later.

Talked to Houston at lunchtime. Still looking for more ideas on getting the printer on the network. After running the steps in OCA message 241 unsuccessfully, Sergei hooked the printer up to the subnet running in the FGB two nights ago and did some more testing. No go on resetting the IP address. So we're up for more suggestions on this one.


More on fonts. Major step forward. Sergei is on the Wiener checking out a CD with the Russian ODF on it and all the new Russian data file symbols can be read by "Word". Someone on the ground has created a file to interpret and display these symbols. We believe this could be added to the Windows environment on the SSC, so all Russian data file could move around the network as word documents vice having to be in the PDF format we are now using. We need to do this also.

Opened Progress O2 tank and increased station pressure about 9 mm.

OCA conference with the STS-97 crew does not hook up. Will try again Sunday.

Sergei on the TVIS. Shep and Yuri on the velo.

Yuri and Sergei set up for regeneration of water from KTB-1. Ground shut down CKB-1 (air conditioner) earlier. We always seem to get an "unexpected shutdown CKB" caution on this. KTB-1 is emptied through the regenerative system in SRVK.

Sergei and then Yuri do the cycle ergometer in the hand mode, for a medical check. 150 watts for 3 minutes--this is hard work. Apparently it's an EVA prep requirement. Data goes to the ground.


End of the workday. Disc 2 of Apocalypse Now. Found "Kurtz" .

Morning comm session, then urolux, followed by finger sticking and reflotron,

Breakfast and comm with TsUP regarding daily schedule. Discussion that yes, Progress is unloaded but we have a lot of stowage and inventory work left to do.

Shep picks up the acoustic dosimeters and logs the data in notebook.

Sergei and Yuri start going through bags of gear packed in Progress. Still looking for the KTO's we need with stuff in them.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 24 lines]

Checs and MEC are now 0 for 3 for the morning. Shep looking for Kona coffee and some simple mechanical task that can be readily completed--found it:
Hooked up temp sensor T265 to the SM-PXO air duct, which had to be rigged backwards to make everything fit right, but it works!

Sergei and Yuri still going through items one at a time against the IMS database on the Wiener laptop. Shep working on getting Progress ready for restowing items to be taken off station. TsUP wants to have c.g. low with everything secure for the redocking capability after 4A departure.

Shep on TVIS, Yuri on velo. Ops normal.

Logging acoustic data on MEC. Numbers are roughly 61-63 dB around our sleep locations, 75 in work areas and central post, and 80-85 around the noisiest equipment.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 4 lines]

1330 Crew changed out EDV no 4. (We're averaging 5 days on these).

1410 Conference with specialists in TsUP about what was loaded in KTO containers in Progress cargo. Still trying to account for stuff in KTO # 4.

1500 OCA comm pass, phone patch with Chief, CB, followed by ham pass over Houston.

Reattempted the Winscat test by logging in as a new user. It worked, and seems to associate Shep with his previous data in database. Ground may want to look at this. Opened the Polar heart rate monitor software again, to try and clean up crew ID's and to see if the exercise dates could be logged automatically. Could not find an easy way to do the logging.

Spent the rest of the afternoon inventorying gear from Progress. We expect to be complete with inventory and storage Sat, although we are still looking for several items which are not located yet. We have got to sort out gear to go into Progress and load it, which should go faster, but will still be a substantial effort. We estimate we need 2 days for this.

Watched disk 1 of "Apocalypse Now". Shep tried to explain why Robert Duvall is always wearing the black cavalry hat, but being a Navy guy, he's not sure he understands it either.

0615 Up and about trying to sort out the medical procedures and gear for periodic crew medical checks. We should have prepped the gear Weds night--didn't. Went to pick individual items out of the med kit-- but should have taken the whole bag into the SM. OCA "weekly" medical message was pretty good in outline of what is happening but Shep is in the habit of reading the form 24 to the last "bykvia" and this slows things way down. For instance, misinterpreted the English letters "st"on the form 24--thinking this meant the Russian word "stranitsa" (page) when it really stood for "step". (Too early in the a.m.)

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 12 lines]

Shep did the exam on Yuri and Sergei, Sergei did Shep. Crew's healthy. Put the data in the MEC. Felt the look and feel of the data entry fields should agree more strongly with what's in the Med Checklist.

Sergei and Yuri grabbing gear from what was bagged in Progress and literally inputting it piece by piece in the Wiener IMS database. Shep is wondering when we're going to one merged IMS so we can use the SSC's and bar code reader to make changes. We are basically OK with the computer interface--searches are reasonably efficient. Moving stuff and logging it has taken a lot of time but we are getting more proficient. We still think we will have to go locker by locker and optimize how gear is placed in each one. Right now things are just put away in logical groupings.

1000 Limited success with OCA--still having config issues somewhere in the link. BME back room comes in clear on the voice uplink--so we think one of the more persistent problems (one-way voice) has to be a ground config issue.

1130 Shep on the TVIS--performance nominal. Hopefully the PC cards have all the TVIS data and we will get that to the ground tomorrow. Some confusion on the TVIS control panel, and how it is decoding the cards--talked about this earlier. TVIS not recognizing Shep's card correctly-- we'll send the data down and let the ground sort it out.

Late morning--SM is in [PCO+P] XPOP orientation, so we have a fairly steady attitude looking out the window. Deck ports are aimed right at Jupiter, with 3 moons visible.

Yuri on the TVIS before lunch, then Sergei on TVIS. He is usually running without the SPD's and it looks fine. Shep and Yuri are using them.

More stowage ops after lunch. Schedule for the day turned out well--thanks to the planners for pulling out the other low priority tasks. Thanks from us for deferring the medical "dry-run" emergency training.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 2 lines]

1510 Excellent ham radio pass over Houston. Voice quality of ham radio continues to be well above any of our other links.

Shep and Sergei scope out a small task, which was on, form 24--moving a temperature sensor. This was pulled from the worklist today. Looked at the length of wire run, and decided that the sensor would not reach the intended ductwork. Back to the planning shed on that one. Could use the pin-kit wire connectors to make it longer, but standing by for TsUP to say what next.

1600 Shep--family conference on OCA. Again, family ops on OCA from the BME room in Houston go very well. Good voice and audio quality--well above what we see in the front room. Availability of the once-a-week video is a real plus.

1620 Opened up "section 1" of the Progress O2 tanks and put 10mm more pressure in the station.

Everyone got a second "gym" session in starting about 1730.

Shep set up the acoustic dosimeters for another 24 hour monitoring. The dosimeters located over Yuri's bunk on 3rd plane FGB, on SM panel 435 in the "wardroom", and in the overhead of the port cayuta. 9v. battery supply for these guys is becoming limited--we have 1 reload left for the dosimeters. Data will be logged on MEC along with other info requested and sent down tomorrow.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 3 lines]

Progress now completely unloaded, but we are still stowing a lot of gear. Several small items which are on the Progress shipping documents are unaccounted for, and we are picking through what has already been stowed. We may have the same "KTO" issue as yesterday--we have 2 KTO's which we learn are supposed to have things in them. We have not dug them out, opened them, and gone through what is inside. We're hopeful to find some of the stuff we are looking for.

We feel much better about the general pace of things, and what we got done today. Wednesday was a lot of frustration and lost time running things down that maybe could have been done later. We're happy that the planners are hearing our input and adjusting.

One thing that might prove useful to all--It would be nice to have some way to sort and "find" OCA and radiogram messages in one "combined" (US and Russian) index. We need more than the message number--some better way to organize this where we can dig out title, subject, date, etc. is in order. As we continue to build larger archives of message traffic, we're going to need this real soon.

0630 Up and about. First pass with Moscow. Glavny's doing his best to create humor but it's just too early in the morning.

0805 Second pass. We discuss rigging of airflow sensors. We are thinking if we are going to go to the trouble now of rigging the "IP's" as they are called, we would like some confidence that they will work. Don't know that is in the plan, but there should be some simple and safe way to test 'em. Voiced down that we are still having problems with printer. We ask for specialist conference with J. Michel in Houston.

Shep working on getting the MEC on the network. Yuri and Sergei stowing electronic parts. Sergei puts in a compressor for the ACY system, which will be needed for later Progress transfers. Shep spends 2+ hours trying to load the network driver for MEC. Have to unrig a lot of stuff on the server to use PC cards before he realizes he could have probably done this from the comfort of the C.O.'s cabin on SSC 2. MEC comes up on the network (major accomplishment for a Mac-guy) but still some configurations messed up. Waiting to talk to Houston.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 34 lines]

Checking the gas analyzer with telemetry going to the ground. Some calibration difference in our CO2 readings.

More stowage and inventory ops.

Shep sets up another round of acoustic dosimeters--all three are back up with new batteries. Two are in the SM sleep stations and the third goes on the bulkhead by central post. (we did Yuri's bunk in FGB last week).

Yuri is working on connecting the velo to the telemetry system but the connector is wrong. More discussion with the ground. The impact-driver is out again, taking off the velo-ergometer. We reroute what we think to be the right cable--but we'll wait until tomorrow to see what the ground says.

Some discussion late in the day with TsUP regarding our "progress" with Progress. Even though we are 70% unloaded, a lot is not restowed, and we think it will take 2 full days to finish the unload and get stowage somewhat in order. Then we will still have to gather up what goes back into Progress, when, and in what order. Plus the transfer items for 4A. We try to give the planners our sense of how it's going and estimates of time required.

End of the day--everyone in the "gym". We are definitely getting better at setting up the TVIS. We just leave it running now and try and get on it "back to back". Everyone gets in a session on velo as well.

Dinner in the wardroom as usual. Decided not to go for the ham and smoked turkey--saving this for tomorrow.

We did get a moment during the "gym" period to talk to Houston on OCA. It was a good chance for each of us to say a few words about the Thanksgiving holiday. Sergei went right to the point--highlighting the excellent support we have from the ground teams. To all the folks keeping watch on us--Thanks!

0700 First comm pass with TsUP. Discussed printer problem with network comm. Decided to change out printer for 2nd. unit.
Changed out printer. Could not get it to talk on the network.

Second comm pass--beeping noise at the central post--can't figure out what it is. It turns out the combustion products analyzer is running out of battery power and is stuck on the bulkhead at the central post.

0805 Try to reload MEC for 30-45 minutes-no joy. Several attempts with different floppies, CD's, and new hard drive--computer is hanging up trying to execute the autoloader software.

0943 First red light on the caution and warning panel. Smoke sensor 1 in PXO active. Sensor tested and reset--no alarm. Sergei paws through some stowage to see what's right by the sensor. PXO looks completely normal. At least the warning tones are noticeable.

1000 Attempted backup of SSC file server (20 minute procedure) Hardware configuration requires saving files and shutting down SSC2 to get at the PC extender. Extender won't go on File Server until hardware is removed, which requires shutting down FS, and removing PC card bracket and ethernet card. More restarts required to get things going. Backup procedure unexpectedly shuts down FS. When restarted, FS comes up but network is down. FS is down again. Sergei helping with the troubleshooting--already spent 2 hours on this and still not working. Something wrong with the power supply? We swap supplies with the router--FS is working. Then the suspect power supply starts working again. We're stumped. The good news is that the network is up. The bad news--we will probably see this again.


1200 Yuri gets on the TVIS. Shep puts new battery in the CSA-CP.

1300 Sergei and Shep hook up second (Lab) printer on the FGB subnet. It works. Right before the net goes down. Some more discussion with TsUP, and we are guessing the network card is bad. We swap cards and the problem is definitely linked to the card. So we are configured with SM printer and Lab network card. Just have to put it on the right subnet now.

1330 Shep on the TVIS and then velo--ops normal.


Tried again to load software on the MEC computer. Hooked up another floppy drive which seems to work better. At least the software runs without the previous read errors. Shep tries the latest CD, which starts OK but then has "critical" problems. After about 4 more attempts to get through this, retry to load with a second CD. This is kind of cranky too, with lots of read errors, but nothing which kills the load. Finally the MEC computer has an update., We check with TsUP for relay to Houston to see if the software version is acceptable.

Sergei and Yuri pulling spare boxes out of Progress and stowing them. We are trying to locate things as close as possible to where they will be used. Still have over half of Progress to deal with and the big stuff is all down low in the module. We may have to take off the docking assembly--but we want to see if we can extract the big pieces without doing that. Large cylinder is the liquid block for electron. We debate how to get it off its frame and whether it will pass through the hatch as is. We decide it's a project for tomorrow.

Sergei on TVIS and the velo.

Comm pass. Some joking with Moscow about the table that we're missing. We don't expect to see it now on our flight, although it is something that would make habitability better in the SM. We do some talking on the second VHF channel. For some reason, VHF channel 2 is much clearer than chan. 1 which is always fuzzy onboard. The best voice quality onboard is the ham radio.

More words from Houston on VHF about OCA dropouts. No one can explain the inconsistent performance. We are looking for something strange which may affect the circuit on station but nothing is readily apparent.

We call it a day and lay into the new load of chow from Progress. CD movie is "LA Confidential". We may have to watch this one several more times.

0900 Crew is up. OCA must have worked overnight, as we have files onboard. Thinking about what to do with all the Progress gear. Reviewing where we got to on Saturday--

On Sat. we got up late afternoon, strapped on the power tools and spare batteries, and "locked and loaded" with the 12mm sockets. Sergei led the way into the top of the Progress. Sergei said the nose of the docking probe "smells like space". It did have kind of a burnt toast odor to it--very faint. Sergei coached Shep to start the unload. Shep started "power tooling", taking fasteners off. Job #1 was to clear out something so the hatch could swing full open. Got down under the docking gear and got Chibis loose, but this was too bulky to get around the hatch so we put it back. Then took the EDV package apart in its frame and started passing EDV's out piece by piece. This works. And soon there is enough room to swing the hatch open and start moving serious equipment. We find the documentation package, and the cargo diagrams in a white bag. Shep is thinking "how did these guys ever get this thing loaded?" All the EDV's, KTO's, out. Pump packages and spares come out. BKO's for SRVK out. Everything strapped to the deck in FGB. First layer of gear in Progress is cleared out, but now we have the large "containers" each with a pile of stuff about 2m deep to deal with. At least we can get at the top of it.
Sergei and Yuri work on putting a pump in the SOTR system rack, just to get it out of the way. We take a break about 2130 for some chow, and to go through the care packages that we found on Progress. The troops are pretty happy that we have all our "loot", and the mail from home is great. Sergei got some excellent kielbassa--we test this right away. Cranked up the laptop and we watch disk 1 of "Sixth Sense". We call it a night at about midnight.

1100 Back to Sunday--Discussion with TsUP. We are kind of interested to know if the work/wardroom table was flown up on the Progress. Does not look like it's onboard. TsUP says they think it's still on the ground. Not a big problem--we were debating for a long time prelaunch whether we had room for all 3 sections anyway. We asked that at least one of the fold out parts not fly to give us more room in the aft part of SM. So now we're thinking how to make something up which will serve in the interim. We joke with TsUP about sending up some plans so we can make a table on orbit. Lots of possibilities in Progress--brackets and frame material everywhere.
Sergei and Yuri are working on the plan to unload Progress--approach is methodical chaos--attack fasteners, unpack a bit, stow a bit. Seems like a good plan. Shep is worried that we will never figure out how to put it all back together and close the hatch, but Sergei says no problem.

Talk with Houston on VHF. We discuss OCA issues. Reboot and diagnostic test proceed without problems. We're thinking about how we are transitioning from mail which was on an OCA file, and then on the SSC server, and now moving to the "outlook" world. We don't think we completely understand what the SSC file server and the individual client machines are doing with respect to each other, handling the outlook files. How we stay sync'd up is the issue. This would probably be transparent to us if the comm link was better, but we are concerned about losing things if they don't happen to get put in the right place onboard.

1300 Shep on TVIS. Normal ops. Yuri gets on the velo.

1500 Sergei gets on TVIS and can't get the belt going. All other indications normal. We try to shut it down and restart. No joy. Another power cycle and still not working. Then Yuri tweaks the emergency stop magnet about 1mm and everything is OK. Another TVIS lesson learned.

1520 OCA family comm. Connection with Houston is about the best we have had so far. Video clear, and voice quality reasonable. If we could just keep OCA working at this level, we would have it made..

1700 Another conversation with TsUP--specialists are discussing how we are tracking all the US equipment as well as Russian gear--whether we are using US "plans" or not.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 5 lines]

Sergei and Yuri are doing some more inventory. We decide to move the food containers--the used ones have to be staged ready for the Progress departure, and the new ones dug out of the middle of the stowage in Progress. So Shep back in the Progress with tools and Yuri and Sergei are moving gear. We really had the FGB squared away last week and now Sergei and Yuri are in a sea of bags and boxes. After about 2 hours we have the food boxes organized and stowed.

We have one last comm pass with TsUP. Some joking around with Glavni and this is a welcome change to the usual technical and ops comm. We sign off and get some dinner. Finished disk 2 of "Sixth Sense" --nobody liked it. Yuri said he picked it as he thought it was the sequel to "Fifth Element". We let him off easy.

0530 First comm pass with TsUP. CO2 up a bit (8mm). We get instructions to start a new CO2 absorber cannister and cycle the VOZDUK. Sergei, Shep, and Yuri break out the Makitas--two subframes have to come out of SM 417 to get the absorber cannister out--its normal fasteners are inaccessible. But it is fairly straightforward to remove the brackets, and we are in the coffee locker by 0630.

0705 Next comm pass with TsUP. Discussed Progress docking comm plan and viewing angles. It would really help here to be able to generate a few snapshots of birds eye view on what station attitudes will look like. We voice this to idea to Houston.Shep, Sergei, Yuri discussing hatch config for docking and location of things we might need.

0900 Shep doing the MEC reload procedure. Floppy disk has some errors on it which the boot software does not like. No-go on the reload procedure, and all the Med Ops downloads for the day get put on hold. More discussion with Houston about a way to get around the bad disk files. We are thinking that this software could be uplinked and we can create the boot disk onboard.

1000 Shep on the TVIS. Discovered that the treadmill can be manually commanded to different speeds "on the fly" by selecting new number for belt speed and pushing enter. This eases the difficulty of manipulating the speed "up/down" arrows and makes changing speed in manual mode much more straightforward. TVIS session OK.

All hands engaged in putting bags away and making space in FGB and SM for staging gear from Progress. Vacuumed the filters in SM.

Sergei and Shep did final routing of the twisted wire pair in FGB for the network. Cable run is completely behind panels except for small stub which goes into the PC card. Exposed network wiring in general is at a minimum, with most of the ethernet in SM run behind panels.


OCA problems continuing through the day. Lots of restarts and power cycles, but no real improvement in the situation. Comm with the ground is very unpredictable.

Crew knocks off at 1400. We're up later in the evening for Progress ops.

2200 Crew is up and about. Going through the radiograms, onboard instructions, etc. getting ready for Progress docking. Cameras and camcorders loaded up.

Have had a fairly "old" state vector onboard for the world map, and we would like to talk to Houston to fix this. With the bad comm, we just can't make it happen. Decide to try and input the SV data from the Russian laptop's nav/details page into the world map. It works! (or seems to). We think we have scored one here. We try the same thing with the Bird's Eye View and the Russian attitude quaternion--does not look as good. Maybe some of the ADCO's can figure out how to do this.

Progress approach and docking goes pretty much to plan. Yuri gets TV tally of station from Progress camera about 7 km out and Sergei has a visual at 1+ km. TV scan is stable--would have been unusable without Thursday's IFM. In comparison to Shuttle, Progress can maneuver pretty quickly. Progress stationkeeps directly under us, and then Yuri drives it in slowly for the docking. TV picture is not as defined as we were expecting, and picking up the docking target is quite challenging. Yuri has it lined up inside of about 5 meters. Lighting was OK--target is just real hard to see. Contact at 0347. Very slight bump felt in SM. Surprised at how benign the loads seem. Rest of the mechanical docking gear works as expected. Systems reconfigured and pressure checks out OK. We are opening hatches just before 0600, and into the Progress for a look at 0630. Later, looking at electronic photos Sergei shot of Progress on final approach strongly suggests ice on the glass cover of the camera housing. This may help explain the TV image issues.

More gear to unload and stow, and another opportunity to use power tools.

Reveille at the usual "zero-dark-early" . Talked with TsUP 0630. Added 1 EDV in parallel with the KPV for water collection from SRVK. We want to avoid putting more water in the "technical" buckets. This will provide more volume for the system to pump potable water into. Apparently there is more moisture in the environmental "loop" than estimated.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 2 lines]

Switched BMP modes--filter cannister 1 in normal ops, #2 in regeneration. No "hot" smell as was experienced when #1 was evacuated and heated.

Sergei and Yuri working on sync problem with the SIMVOL. Previous test image for docking had its video frame distorted. Apparently the sync signal was malfunctioning. Ground discussion about removing sync input from the video signal. Looking for a way to do this. Impact tool is chowing down on fasteners, but cable leads are unable to reach monitor directly from sync box.

Yuri and Sergei continue to clean up inventory notes for the last several days of logistics moves. Shep is picking up a week's worth of nuts and bolts taken off of panels, brackets, parts, etc.

1400 Shep did another test of the Sound Level Meter (SLM). Repeated steps 1-7 in the procedure. SLM failed again. (-7.5 dB calibration delta). Per words from Houston, put it back in the box.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 13 lines]

Shep stowed additional gear in the medical locker in SM per radiogram 15. Could not find the new labels mentioned in the radiogram for the older "ykladkies". Reflotron left in FGB as we don't feel we have room for it on SM panel 336--it will be in the way of SSC3 which is over the doorway for starboard cayuta. But IMS knows where it is.

1420 Crew talked to TsUP about bypassing the sync box on SIMVOL. Got a "wait out". Spent some time looking thru the "pin kit" for pins and sockets that might work. Everything we had was a bit too big (22 gauge).

Sergei and Yuri continue to do inventory ops, and work the SIMVOL video connection

1700 Sergei and Yuri get a good SIMVOL test after bypassing the sync box. Signal is transmitted from Soyuz. Picture looks solid. Sergei was pretty resourceful, as usual, finding coax parts off other cabling to create a jumper to do the job. From CDR point of view, effort was outstanding.

Just a note here---we will want to add US and Russian bus/coax repair to our list of onboard capabilities. A handful of couplers and a crimp tool could go a long way.

Shep on TVIS---ops nominal until he has to pause for something, then could not get the TVIS to restart. Several attempts to resume did not work. A power cycle brought it back to operation. Have also had continuing problems with the keypad not responding to inputs. Found that pushing harder on the keypad actually makes it work somewhat better.

Sergei on TVIS and Yuri on the velo.

Sergei gets the Wiener to "ping" on the twisted pair network lateafternoon. It can now see the router, server, and subnet in the FGB and SSC clients on the net. The only outstanding unit is the printer. We have about three blinking lights on the back panel of the printer but it's not on the net. We are out of ideas on how to troubleshoot this one and we need some more input from the ground on what to do next.

We have to redo the digital photo of the PTAB #4--checked the image we have and it is too soft. Will redo and send as we have time.

Summary of the day--outstanding work with the SIMVOL "no-notice" IFM. Made good progress on the network, and stowage and inventory settling down a bit. Ready for the Progress to "come aboard". Shep thinks the Navy term is "Romeo at the dip" but Brent Jett may want to check this.

0730 Conducted comm session with TsUP. Sent down 4 min. camcorder recording shot on Tuesday. Hope it's useful. Still troubleshooting OCA problems. Houston requested reboot of OCA which was performed. OCA still running slow although RAM and disk space appears very adequate.

0830 Shep and Sergei got the BCR to take new download of v. 103 software successfully. BCR serial 1003 loaded. Per ODF, second BCR not loaded. Need a call here if both BCR's are to be matched up.

File server backup scheduled for 14 Nov was delayed while we work OCA issues and reorganize files on server. Hope this OK with the SSC group.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 6 lines]

1050-1130 Shep and Sergei reload OCA from PC hard card. Load runs OK. OCA looks like it is up.

Yuri on TVIS--perfomance nominal. We are getting better at turning it on and off without procedural missteps. The only thing we really need that we do not have is a way to manually step up the speed on the belt in increments greater than 0.1 km or mph per button click, or let the button scroll if continuously depressed. We are wondering if a software patch could fix this.

Sergei on velo. Shep on velo. No comments other than getting more used to the control panel. Good exercise device--simple and easy to use.

1400 switched BMP filter unit 1 to regeneration mode.

1400 Sergei and Yuri photograph bent pin on electrical socket of PTAB 4 for transmission to ground. Sergei used 180mm lens to minimize distortion. This is something crews should practice in photo class.

1420 Sergei and Yuri resume electrical test of twisted wire pair. Got good electrical connectivity with a separate cable behind medical locker. Apparently there was some previous error in hooking up twisted pair and circuit was not joined to exterior twisted pair connector at all. Circuit checks OK now. Waiting for more words on Thursday to connect up the Wiener. Give us some more interesting things to do with the Scopemeter!


We hope to get some resolution tomorrow on whether the Wiener and the SSC router are going to "carry the mail". In addition, a few big picture words would be most helpful as to how the ground's going to structure files and run up/down data now that we are using the server. We are assuming that everything we will want to access or send to the ground will be in a folder on the server. Just want to make sure we are on the same page.

Sergei and Yuri restowing gear in FGB. Shep cleaning up US ODF stowage and other gear in SM. We are looking pretty shipshape, and hoping that we have correctly logged where everything is. For BME's, Shep did find the RS 232 cable for TEPC--thanks for the identifying info.

Shep on TVIS, Sergei on TVIS. Function is normal. We are now using the control panel fastened to the support tube, port side, which is a very convenient way to stow it once we're done--it just swings back into the passageway to PRK. We are finding running 2 folks back to back on the TVIS helps keep the setup overhead low. Planners--keep up the good work.

Finished the day with a look thru the server for new radiograms, messages, etc.

Crew is in a happy mood now that we better understand the twisted pair problem. Looking forward to bringing the network completely on-line soon.

Big kudos to Sergei Gulakov today for coming to us with phonetic alphabet calls for English commands on the laptop. This will make calls for keystrokes and like things much more precise. If Houston has a standard phonetic list for the cyrillic alphabet we could use a copy onboard so Shep can study.

0345 Got SIMVOL going for docking test-- worked ok. SIMVOL time was approx 10 seconds off from GMT shown on station clocks and laptops.


0700 Comm check with TsUP. Packets sent up.

0830 Comm pass. Tried to uplink packets on VHF 2 and transmit a "voice over" for the TV downlink on VHF 1. Lots of bleed through on the audio--it sounded unusable on this end. Tried to narrate the downlink anyway. We spent 1 1/2 hours Monday putting together as a video summary of what we have been doing last week. We did not feel that the end result was that productive.

0930 Comm with Houston. Discussed OCA downlink and PAO details for Weds. Agreed that it would be best if we only downlink 3-4 .avi movie files at a time, with file sizes under 20Mb.


[REDACTED MATERIAL - 6 lines]

1115 Took TEPC data and logged in ODF hard copy. Numbers as follows:

GMT 11:16 / Dose Rate .002 / Total Dose 45.81 / Elapsed time 2643 / Start File 1 / End File 38 / Current file 38 / Dose Equivalent Rate .002 / Total Dose Equivalent 145.67 / Flags "OE"

We are ready to hook up MEC to the lan if we can get some help with IP addresses and client configurations.


Yuri installed "TSENTR" electronic equipment in the medical rack.

1150 Yuri changes out KTO-1. Shep and Sergei helping. Makita impact tool used to demount/mount the KTO cans. Procedure is much faster with power tools. (same comment with EDV's). Probably save 20 minutes over doing this with hand wrenches.

Talked with Houston about moving OCA up/down files on to the file server. All large .avi movie files are now on the server in the "OCA down" folder and off of OCA storage. Sergei brings up the good point that OCA access for downlink may be slowed up by network transfers. We need more discussion with the ground about the organization of uplink/downlink files on the server to understand how this will be used. Request any advice here.

Another OCA note--accessing the OCA machine peer to peer, we are unable to make the links work between the execute package and the SSC clients. Links do work on the OCA laptop. Don't understand this. Problem has persisted since the network was originally set up.

Sergei swapped hard disks from Russian Laptop #2 to the operating laptop on the central post. It is back in working order. However, we do not have a backup for the Solaris/Unix OS which gave us the problem and we are operating on our only working load. We request that 4A bring at least one complete hard drive as a backup for the Russian laptop.

OCA file transfer problems in the afternoon. Did several reboots, cleaned off large avi files, dismissed unnecessary apps. OCA still appears to be running slow although lots of storage and RAM available. We are thinking to try again Wednesday with ethernet network card turned off, to reduce processing demand on OCA. Will wait for ground OK to do this.

Started to check out the sound level meter (SLM) as per form 24. Got through step 7.3 on the activation procedure when the SLM failed the calibration test. Deviation was minus 7.18 dB. Turned it on anyway and waved the meter around a bit in FGB and SM. Frequency spectrum response looked reasonable and obtained readings in the 62-65 dB range, but don't know what these numbers mean based on failed calibration. Waiting for words from Houston on how to proceed.

Shep tried to complete the "On orbit hearing assessment" per the flight plan. Unable to locate the EarQ software on the MEC. Icon is not present in the CHECS apps folder, and searched the "C" drive for application unsuccessfully. Thought that since the MEC had not been loaded with new disk image, that the necessary software may be only on the new load. Tried to image the MEC. Could not locate the boot floppy disk as called in step 7.3 of the MEC activation and checkout. We need some words on this one, also.

Sergei started procedure from OCA message to update the Bar Code Reader (BCR) software. Using an RS 232 line to SSC 3, He was unable to open a serial com port to talk to the BCR. We think the problem may be with SSC configuration but SSC 3 was imaged at activation along with the other SSC's. Com ports are available on other machines and we do not understand this difference. Will reimage SSC 3 tomorrow and try this again.

In summary, productivity of the day was at best, modest. Limited availability of comm is having a significant impact on the crew's ability to work through minor issues with the ground team's help. We need a little advice here and there to keep the flow of work moving, but we just have not been able to talk enough. We are probably keeping the planners busy as they reschedule what we did'nt finish. We will try to make things work as smoothly as we can.

0630 Received good packet comm from the ground per radiogram 14.

Noted SM attitude change. Crew would definitely like more "heads up" as regards attitude timelines and maneuvers. Coordinating this with bird's eye view "birdseed" would also be useful.

Shep started to work on organizing video from the past 2 weeks to prepare for PAO events this week. We have 5+ Sony DV cam tapes shot so far. Will attempt to make highlights of these tapings available on OCA downlink as .avi files.

Sergei and Yuri spend most of the a.m. going through notes from Sunday gear restow and clean-up. We still are going to have some issues with things that don't agree in the IMS database which are "legacy" inaccuracies. Sergei and Shep feel pretty strongly that we need to get the Wiener and the SSC file server talking and sharing the same data ASAP so the ground can help us manage this.

Sergei made the first ham radio contacts from station on a pass over Moscow.

1010 Shep cycled on the ergometer and Yuri started a TVIS run. Both exercise sessions were normal.

1055 Shep and Sergei contacted ham station at Goddard. Comm quality of the VHF circuit was excellent. Signal to noise and readability of the ham radio is better than our other comm circuits.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 11 lines]

We do plan on providing a "made for downlink" tape for the 14 Nov crew status report. This will be a 4 minute recording with scenes summarizing what some of our activities looked like last week. We will voice over commentary on VHF audio. Please keep in mind that this is shot "back to back" as we are unable to edit.as shot. With the short comm passes, this is the best we can do. Any other ideas from the ground here would be appreciated.

1400 Shep changed out EDV-Y No. 2. We had about 86 ACY cycles on the first EDV and got to a total of 165 on the second.

Sergei and Yuri repack and restow one locker in FGB and continue to check notes with the IMS database on the Wiener laptop. Have not used the barcode reader as yet--waiting for network and database sharing to be resolved.

Still receiving intermittent power level cautions from the SM CEP system. This is apparently designed as an alert to the crew that we are nearing a negative power balance to avoid increasing electrical load if possible.

Shep and Sergei got a TVIS run in the afternoon. No squawks. User interface is still complicated, but we are learning.

Combustion products analyzer is firing off once or twice a day for 2-3 seconds and then returning to normal. The only parameter which looks close to its limit is HCL which has been 0.8. Have been unable to catch it fast enough when it is in alarm to see what values are causing this.

Experienced OCA dropout for late afternoon/early evening. We rebooted several times with no resolution. Houston came up again through VHF and requested another reboot. All uplink, downlink and other status info on OCA/Proshare was appearing normal (green). The reboot brought us back up with Houston.

1845 Good ham radio pass with Houston. Voice quality as before--excellent.

Approx 1930 experienced a "crash" with the Russian PCS laptop. Attempting to reboot the PC gave indication that the Sun OS would not load. Boot s/w can not read root directory correctly. Even Sergei didn't understand this one. Talked with TsUP and decided to wait for specialist advice tomorrow.

We appreciate the attention to detail from TsUP and Houston in making sure we have good targets and plans for the following day before close of business. This is the way it should be. Thanks!

Morning test of the packet comm to Wiener is successful. (Afternoon test of the packet comm has some problems, which we attribute to low line of sight with ground station.)

0730 Sergei and Yuri start checking assembly of the ham radio installation in FGB and making connection to the antenna coax.

Seems that we are still having OCA config problems. Went through a long pass with CAPCOM where we were in some kind of "simplex" mode. Every time Houston audio was available to us, we lost uplink video. Apparently downlink comm was solid and we got a lot of words down.

Sergei and Yuri start reorganizing and doing inventory of stowage in FGB. Shep is working on squaring away the computer software problems from the previous day with SSC 2.
We all spend the remainder of the working day just putting things away and consolidating where possible. We plan on continuing this on Sunday as well. Lots of improvement in the FGB. Yuri's sleeping bag is laid out fore and aft on locker faces on plane 4 of the FGB interior. A large volume in this area is now clear of stowage so he can have some room. (Sergei and Shep are moved into the SM cayutas, on planes 2 and 4.)

1600 went to 6th regime on VOZDUK. Now operating all 3 CO2 absorber beds.

Browsing the IMS on Wiener laptop after dinner, noticed that we have 3 installation toolkits stowed in the Node. Also noted that there are spare metric sockets in these kits.

DECK LOG 10 NOV 00 (Late Entry)

0730 Conducted a video conference with TsUP, commemorating their 40th anniversary of space flight control.

830-920 Shep had first exercise period on the velo-ergometer. Very nice set-up as far as stowage and deployment. Felt that the hand/upper body workout was awkward as far as adjusting the load settings. Basically you have to pedal the "generator" with one hand and punch buttons with the other. Velo-ergometer kept starting at max load (250 watts) and adjusting settings with this initial load was very difficult.

Velo-ergometer had a tight fit between one of its support struts and a padeye on the SM deck. We smoothed the fit up with a large flat file. Sergei had the vacuum cleaner at the ready, but we tried the "Don Pettit" gel method to control the filings. We applied a small amount of aloe gel (clear) to the fitting and filed on it for 10 minutes or so. Cleaned up with a napkin. No loose chips, dust or other debris.

Yuri got a run in on the TVIS, ops normal.

Sergei and Yuri began sorting out parts for the cable connections to be made in the FGB GA for the nadir docking port.

1130 Transited through a very unusual aurora field. Started as a faint green cloud on the horizon, which grew stronger as we approached. Aurora filled our viewfield from SM nadir ports as we flew through it. A faint reddish plasma layer was above the green field and topped out higher than our orbital altitude.

We have been receiving intermittent caution messages on the SM power system--once or twice a day. All indications from the laptop are normal. We believe these are transient data problems as the telemetry system switches formats. No action taken. Relative incidence of alarms in general for SM (and FGB-Node) is surprisingly low. Whatever you ground guys are doing here, let's keep it up!

Keeping an eye on SRVK operation. No more leaks, system is operating normally.

Sergei and Yuri continue to work on the FGB cable connections. Shep is helping out with wiring runs and connector hookups in the GA. Finding the written instructions on cable and connectors very elaborate. This is the sort of thing where a good sketch would greatly help. Some of the English translation misses a bit of the Russian nuance. Russian instruction says look "in the vicinity of hermetic plate" and the English translation was "look on the plate". The connector Shep needs is, in fact on a wire bundle "in the vicinity" of the plate. (lose about 30 minutes sorting this one out). Total work on the job s about 9 man hours. We finish at about 1630.

Sergei is preparing to run on TVIS but we keep getting gyro fault indications. E run the malfunction procedure in the MedOps book and TVIS is back on line. We think our startup sequence was incorrect. Shep runs on TVIS at fairly high SLD load. Performance of the TVIS is OK.

We were configuring SSC 2 to run a CD when it decided to lock up. After repeated attempts to restart, Shep and Sergei went through a long attempt to extract files from the SSC's hard drive before reloading the SSC software. Used the startup disk in the onboard software suite, but could not find a particular file while hunting around with DOS. This would have been much easier with some bootable media (CD-ROM?) that could run Windows. (Or if Shep was not indoctrinated by that "other" operating system). We may need an emergency boot capability again. After 5+ attempts, finally got the hard drive to take an image off the ghost CD. One of the Autoloader floppies went down, but SSC 2 is now running normally. ( 3+ hours troubleshooting).

Network is still not in the configuration we would like it. We have the Wiener power laptop stand-alone, and the printer configured as a local printer from the OCA machine. Waiting on words from the ground to reconfigure both of these devices so they can run on the LAN.

Sergei finishes the working day for us by transferring digital image files to the OCA for downlink. More coming.

0800 Located CPA serial no.1001 on SM 338 near air filter. ( location change). Operating normally.
Found the TVIS flash cards in AMP Pack. Thanks for the heads up on this one. Would not have located those till EOM on my own.

Ground started SRVK operations 0830 or so, pumping condensate from the airconditioner to the purification unit. About 0910 Sergei noticed a major water bubble on the condensate separator in the SRVK unit. Apparently the pump which pulls from the separator into the rest of the system had not been turned on, so everything started backing up and eventually went out the air outlet from the separator. About 500 ml of condensate on the exterior of the pump package. No apparent problems, but this could have been a bigger issue if the water had gotten into a bank of power distribution boxes right behind the pump. We got our water cleanup quals renewed.

Used the first "D" size drawing to troubleshoot the SRVK at 0915. They were very helpful. Please tell the RTII's and the drawing crew that they did good work!! Being able to integrate the functional schematic with the panel logic was very efficient. We think the Ground configured system out of order or did not enable some part of an algorithm and NOK pumped a bunch of condensate into separator block 1. It is squared away now and seems to be operating normally. I was going to make some comment to ground that "unauthorized water pumping is not allowed aboard ship" but I did not get it in on the VHF comm loops.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 21 lines]

Spent some more time on insulating the CKB airconditioning compressor. The relative humidity is up and it was still causing some condensation because of cold flow from the freon lines. We have the thing pretty well wrapped at this point and the condensation is just a few drops here and there where it was 100 ml. blobs before. This should also make the RH go down a bit. Bill for technical work to be sent to Energia.

1500 Found the TEPC and gear and set it up in SM on panel 110, right at the Central Post fwd of VShVT. Spent over an hour on just the rigging alone-but it is in a place where it can live undisturbed for a long while. Could not locate the RS 232 cable which was supposed to be in the kit. Will check the MEC bag to see if it is in there, but if any of the stowage folks know that it has been relocated there this might shorten any search. TEPC has been firing off intermittently, and we are watching the numbers.

We set up ham radio on 4th plane of FGB just forward of PXO. Have not configured the antenna lead yet, but this will be completed Fri. We do have a question as to which computer is supposed to support packet radio? Is it acceptable to use an SSC to do this?


With regard to SSC config, Did a quick continuity check with the grounding leads for the power cables attached to FGB 227, feeding the SSC router and file server in the FGB. Ground to the FGB structure is electrically good. Will change the ground configuration to float with the outlet socket when we get time to do this-probably tomorrow a.m.


Sergei did additional troubleshooting on the Wiener network. Sergei and Yuri successfully connected the Wiener directly to the SSC router and file server bypassing the twisted pair and it pinged OK. So the problem is somewhere in the twisted pair connection. Sergei and Yuri traced down the whole wire run and could not determine any fault inside the pressurized volumes of SM and FGB (this took 3 hrs.) We need a wiring diagram sufficient to do an electrical test if we want to proceed. Also consider we have scopemeter and logic analyzer/labview onboard. However, our recommendation is to forget the twisted pair for now and put the Wiener directly on the FGB subnet. Router can become a spare. We can reconfigure later if desired and troubleshoot the twisted pair wiring at our leisure.

We are out of laptop desks for the SSC's and Wiener. We have 3 and they are all deployed. (Just for background we have 9 laptops deployed and 1 or 2 more that we might want to use.) 2 more desks with bracket hardware would be handy. Until then, we are in a "make our own" mode, and intend to fabricate a substitute desk out of structural discards from Progress or a food container lid. Size of this is just about perfect. Availability of the "Panavise" would be helpful for this activity. Asked TsUP where this was, got some info, and looked in FGB 302, 306, 230,229, no joy. Can we please confirm that this has or has not been been flown?

As the MCC shift changes, our best to the team on the ground for a job well done. It has been an interesting and challenging 10 days--we have all written some space history. Your "Alpha" crew is standing by for the next watch.

0710 Up early for the first TV of the day. Several comm. passes scheduled today with Russian ground sites taking down video.

0720 Crew does TV downlink and talks to Vladimir Tsibleev, Semyanov, and several other folks from ??? cosmonaut office. Happy New Year stuff.

More TV next pass with ??? and lots of specialists passing on their greetings. Russian tradition of having many different people get on the line is a good one.

Yuri, then Sergei get in their family conferences. DV cam sending video down.

We all get to stow our PAO outfits and have some lunch.

Deleted the subfolder "movies" from oca-down folder on the Server. This was MPEG video waiting to go to the ground. All the tapes were sent down on 4A and ground should be able to process these with higher quality than what we had stored. Sergei moved photo files to the Wiener. Server "K" drive now has more than 1 Gb. free storage, plus PC card, but we would still like to know the overall plan as to how this is to be managed.

Everyone catching up on email and computer housekeeping.

We talk a bit about the troubleshooting we did Saturday on the veloergometer. We had trouble hooking up the Russian scopemeter to the charger, as we don't have 2 cables we need to do it. ??? said later they thought cables were on the ground. We used the US scope, although this thing really eats battery power.
Troubleshooting velo is turning out to be more than just a few resistance checks. Diagram the ground sent up is a very high-level format which does not show any real electrical detail. We got instructions to cut 2 connections and isolate a large load resistor. The 2 connections are in fact 8 separate wires. We decided not to cut anything until we better understand how the control head is supposed to work. We set up to measure voltage across one of the resistors . Yuri pedaled for about a minute and we saw a momentary voltage spike of 13 volts, and then the output went flat. Ground said expected output should have been 12 volts steady. We may try to snag this signature on the scopemeter and send to the ground later, although we are not sure we have the Fluke software onboard for the SSC to talk to the scope.

Got the word through Moscow that we would not be clearing out PMA 3 and venting today. This is very good news.

Crew got in TVIS workouts and continued on emails and files. Lots more greetings on every comm. pass. Watched "The World Is Not Enough" and worked on tonight's log:

In longstanding naval tradition, the first entry in a ship's log for the New Year is always recorded in prose. We would like to share with all the entry being made in the log tonight as "Alpha" salutes the New Year-


SHIP'S LOG 0000 01 JAN 2001

We sail onboard space station "Alpha"
Orbiting high above Earth, still in night
Traveling our destined journey
Beyond realm of sea voyage or flight

A first New Year is upon us
Eight strikes on the bell now as one
The globe spins below on its motion
Counting the last thousand years done.

15 midnights to this night in orbit
A clockwork not of earthly pace
Our day with different meaning now
In this, a new age and place

We move with a speed and time
Past that which human hands can tell
Computers programmed-like boxes
Where only thoughts' shadows dwell

"Central post" our ship's bridge aboard
Screens dancing shapes in pale glow
We guide her course by electronic pulse
In figures no compass could show

Our panels set as sails to the Sun
With wake not ever seen but there
Only gyros feel the silent tugs
Wisps, swirls of such ocean rare

On this ship's deck sits no helm now
Rudder, sheet, and rig long since gone
But here still-- a pull to go places
Beyond lines where sky meets the dawn

Though star trackers mark Altair and Vega
Same as mariners eyed long ago
We are still as wayfinders of knowledge
Seeking new things that mankind shall know.

We commend to crews that will follow
Merit of the good ship we sail
Let sun shine strong on Alpha's wings
A symbol, and bright star we long hail

SHIP'S LOG 29 DEC


We're up and getting ready for the "Chibis" session. It's a PAO day, so all the razors are out. We are going to have to do haircuts soon.

0750 First TV session with ???, and since we don't have the scheduled Energia videocon, we say happy New Year to a lot of the specialists in Moscow.

Shep does the CMG reconfiguration for SSC 3 in the Node. We have everything set up here so that we can get through this in about 40 minutes, counting all the data logging. We voice the numbers to Houston and the CMGs seem happy.

NCU and FPP experiment restarted after the CMG data take. FPP application seems to be running normally, although we are still not seeing visible traces on the plot.

Yuri starts his Chibis session-same routine as yesterday. An instrumentation pass and then the full session in the apparatus on the following comm. pass. Sergei is doing the setup, comm., and medical instrumentation. The whole process takes about 2 ½ hours.

We do the MPV update on the file server per the OCA note. MPV load does not seem to copy completely and server has a number of error messages. We are apparently out of memory space on the disk, although we're not sure exactly how NT manages its memory. Wait to talk to Houston. We discuss this later in the day, and then delete all the MPV files which frees up about 800 Mb. We also plug in one of the 1 Gb PC cards, so at least for the short term, the server has some more storage space. We would like to know a little more about the long term plan to manage storage on the server--we were kind of wondering when the hard drive was going to get full. Answered that question today.

Lunch and then another OCA media downlink through Houston. Comm was OK, although some of the voice levels with the media contacts were low. At the end of the two sessions, we sent down a New Year's message for media release (see below).

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 3 lines]

We have had intermittent trouble with the ???'s hose for the toilet. The electrical switch which activates the system has not been turning it off properly. It seems to be some kind of intermittent open circuit, which we thought would get lots better or lots worse soon. ??? said to change the hose out, but we are still not sure that is the right fix to the problem, and we may be throwing out a good hose. We asked to delay this while we keep watching how it operates.

We reset the MEC laptop time. It was about 1 minute off of the rest of the system. We are wondering if the ground call to reset the clock had to do with the fact that we logged an IRED workout yesterday as "29 December", as that was the workout that was done, although the date was the 28 th. . IRED program on the MEC does not have the flexibility to accommodate that user change, but we will want to do this.

World map had problems again today. We got another vector that put us on the Equator. If we could get a little more info on where the vector is stored, and how clients get it, we could input this manually if we get stuck again.

1700 Talked with training lead for 5A and CAPCOM about the preliminary 5A material for onboard training. We really like the browser format-this will save us huge amounts of time. The prototype material for FD 4 is going to be very useful. Kudos to the training team from all of us.

Shep and then Sergei on the IRED. We got the note on IRED limits, and we are planning to mark the canisters accordingly. We are doing 2 exercises right now which are at or close to the "12" scale limit-and our adaptation to resistive training in space is still pretty low. Bottom line-this thing is good, but it is going to need more capacity-more resistance, and longer cables.

Finished the day with comm. pass with Moscow-lots of folks on the shift saying hello, as we will not hear from them till next year.

We also would like to share with all our PAO downlink words today:


The exploration of Space is a powerful symbol--of the promise of a new year, and the possibilities of a new millennium.

We are a small part of the large international team which has in the year past, established this new outpost off the planet. The age- where humans have a presence away from Earth--has already started.

To mark this New Year, the crew of "Alpha" would like to honor the many dedicated men and women who have pioneered space travel--

SHIP'S LOG 28 DEC


0714 First comm. pass with Moscow. It's "Chibis" day. Sergei gets to do it today, Yuri tomorrow. we have an early TV downlink scheduled so we are chowing down a quick breakfast and then cleaning up and putting on our TV outfits.

0830 TV downlink with Moscow stations. Lots of questions how we spent Christmas day, what the "house" looks like, other questions of general interest about how we are living and getting along.

Sergei ready for the pre-Chibis instrumentation check. It's a lot of electrical equipment-Yuri and Shep help get it all set up. First pass is just to verify all the hookups and monitoring equipment is OK. One rev later, Sergei is in the Chibis and it's pumping down. Pretty similar to the US LBNP test, although this looks like it is done a bit quicker.

Shep spent the morning rigging the plastic wire trays flown up on 2A.2B. Used all the 1" white trays (about 25feet worth) just in the SM. Trays cut with scissors and put down with velcro squares--this works well. They really clean up wire runs inside the living spaces and SM is looking much neater. We are passing an Email tonight to CAPCOM asking for more of this stuff as soon as it can be manifested-we have a feeling the Lab will need it.

We got the IRED workouts that came up in the mail. Nice spreadsheet formats. All 3 of us will be using these. Shep put data for 12/28 workout on the MEC and sent it to the server. Some minor issues with how the data is input, but in general, this is workable. We are using IRED every day and all like it.

Around lunchtime, we missed another Earth Obs site, and we figure it could be for several reasons-Yuri's laptop is gaining a couple of minutes each day. We usually work with the world map on his SSC, and this may be throwing the map off. Also, the Progress docking and attitude changes have most likely moved our state vector. So that may be part of the problem. And we are still getting vector uplinks that put us in zero inclination orbits-happened again today.

After lunch, Shep worked on the IMS database and bar code readers. Sergei and Yuri did air sample monitoring, and then some acoustic data takes with the Russian sound level meter.

We all started pulling out the rest of the light trash in the Progress and preparing ???'s, ???'s, and other wet trash for stowage. Surprised at how much light stuff came out of Progress. We moved about 1 1/2 stowage racks worth of bags and containers out and tied them down in the Node.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 10 lines]

Had to reboot the SSC to support the IMS work in the Node. Took the FPP experiment off line, and examined the cable run from the NCU to the Node shell. It is properly connected, and the line is "fair" ("no kinks" for non-nautical types). FPP restarted without errors this time, and SSC readback says it is taking data. Still no visible trace on the screen.

Temperature in the Node seems to be up. We understand the need to keep condensation down-and we are willing to horsetrade some temperature probe data at the points of ground's choice (provided we don't have to move too much) for a little less heat in there.

Ground sent us up an electrical schematic for the Velo. Hopefully we can find some creative way to test some of the circuitry on this.

Ate dinner and watched the first ½ of "Air Force One", then discussed some of the PAO events for tomorrow. Then we hit the email. Each crewperson having access to "their" SSC is really an important thing. We are very glad that we have enough laptops to do this.

0640 We get up, talk to ??? --and are feeling like we have a reasonable schedule for the day.

0745 The workday starts early as usual. Sergei getting ready to install the GPS/GLONASS satellite receiver (ACH). He has about 1 ½ hours scheduled to do this, but the installation is way up on panel SM 338. Access is not good, and lots of cables look like they were routed after the ACH box was installed. They are all in the way. Sergei takes an hour just to scope out the installation and plan how to do it. Job takes 4+ hours, but Sergei comments that it would have been a full day's work if he had just started it without making a good plan.

Shep gets an early start on the FPP activation. Power down the SSC and switch the cabling. SSC is now powered off the RFPDB box on the early comm. rack. Earlier power problems seen on the UOP do not occur, and the SSC boots normally with the parallel port to the FPP gear attached. Received 1 error message when trying to talk to the NCU and called this to the ground. Otherwise, program started normally. Data transfers are showing up in the screen log on SSC, but no visible traces on the voltage plot on the lower screen. Talked with Houston late in the day to discuss possible reasons for this. Will check the NCU-Node shell cable set up tomorrow a.m.

Yuri starts the day pulling foam and light bags out of the Progress to make way for heavier items. ??? would like the Kurs radar back as well. Yuri is unrigging all the cabling so we can move stuff. Big Kurs box about the size of a small refrigerator. Yuri and Shep pull this unit out and stow in the Node. Looks very familiar in the forward part of the Node--we have the alcove around the hatch full of bags again.

After lunch, Sergei and Yuri continue pulling the rest of the Kurs boxes out, and looking for extra connector caps to cover the bare sockets.

Shep gets "bilge diving" quals renewed with the ACY hose and filter change. Lots of help from Sergei and Yuri. Work goes surprisingly well, no leakage or mess. Used hose is placed in a garbage bag (thanks, crew equipment!) and stowed in the ???. ACY checks out OK, then won't shut down. Pull out the drawings and we think the separator has a stuck switch. Yuri gives the system a bit of flush water and we are back to normal.

Shep spends the rest of the afternoon in the Node, putting bar codes on the Node rack and the seat track beside the ZSR soft racks. Was going to work with the bar code reader, but the 1 unit which is loaded with current software decided it would lock itself in the RF mode. Could not get it to jump back to the batch mode. Also, when the bar code application software is launched on SSC 3 (in the Node) the SSC says that it can not talk to the server. SSC 3 is, however, talking on the network with other applications, so something is different about how the server is handing BCR program. Shep tries the same application on SSC 2 with the same result. All this worked yesterday, and we are stumped.

Took a quick look at the audit locations requested in the FGB. Panels 210, 311, 313 don't have any stowage behind them. The rest have some gear stowed-mostly small items. Checked the database against quick notes of what was in these locations. Will do a full audit on these panels as we have time.

We got the SSC file server backed up per the daily plan. Finally have this configured so we don't have to change any hardware. Backup took a while. Kept getting messages that "registry" was full, although backup eventually completed itself. We believe that the server is trying to handle a lot of program transactions, and this is taking most of the computing power it has.

All hands got some time on the IRED and the TVIS. Ops normal. Did the TVIS weekly maintenance, and we are getting light chafing on the plastic sheath for the SLD cables, near the pulleys which feed the cable up off the TVIS running surface. We will watch this.

Late in the day, we are having discussions with Moscow and Houston about location of the OCA. Convenience factor of having the OCA where we can continually hear it and see it is strong, and we think regardless of where it is located in the near term, that having it near PCS and SSC (on central post) for lab activation and checkout should be a requirement.

We are thinking about how to lay down some more wire trays-and how we will fasten them. The best solution for right now seems to be velcro. Put some big squares down on the tray in the Node and they are holding. We plan on rigging some more of the small Shuttle-style trays in SM to trim up cable runs to the laptops.

We are also waiting on some words regarding the condensate on the exterior lines for CKB. Unit is producing fairly sizeable bubbles of water-maybe 50g each. We had a similar problem on CKB-2 which was readily fixed with some insulated wrapping and a bit of airconditioner tape, and we are ready to do this again.


Probably used the impact tool 5-6 times today on different things-and it was a light day. Large visegrips got on the scoreboard twice, not counting their semi-permanent task of holding a leg on the wardroom table.

Another most excellent day--with tools and drawings deployed simultaneously.

612 Talking with ??? about the plan for docking the Progress.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 4 lines]

Getting ready for the Progress docking. Still getting products on OCA that we have trouble printing out. Have to open the docking diagram-OCA 734--from "acrobat" to print it. The printer won't take the file right off the browser. We have seen this intermittently before.

Had OCA video up for the Progress docking. Picture quality on the SSC looked good. We could not tell what the ground was receiving, but we got words that the resolution was significantly reduced. Approach and fly around of the Progress looked normal-no apparent oscillation. The TV image showed good lighting and contrast. For the last 100m or so when Yuri was driving, the visibility of the target area was significantly better than the previous docking-we had a clear image of target alignment 15-20m out.

Yuri gets a "petyourki" for nailing the docking cone. We opened the FGB hatch and the skid mark on the inside of the cone is about 7 cm. off of dead center. Opened the Progress hatch. Pretty cool inside-maybe 8 deg C. We are glad to have some more volume onboard for stowage. Set up the ducting after prolonged discussion with Moscow about which duct to use.

Shep finished the surface samples. SSK's analyzed, and data logged in the MEC. Zero fungus and low bacteria counts. TEPC read, and numbers from Med Ops, pg 456, left to right:

26 dec / 15:45:40 / .003 / 18.08 / 1679 / 1 / 351 / 352 / .011 / 68.91 / 0E

Shep also trying to log some of the IRED data on the MEC, but the computer keeps saying it can't find a file named "C:\Checs\exer\ired\cdr\sdi2261.dat" and won't open. Help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Earth Obs-We have a "target board" up near the central post, and we are going to try to shoot what is on it every day. Unfortunately, Tuamotou, today's site, got by us. We might have read the time tag incorrectly-but we were well past it at the GMT called out. We will try to do better at this.

Had a good discussion late in the day with CAPCOM and the IMS folks on fixing some of the IMS issues. We discussed updating the databases and getting better operational understanding of how we need to use the bar codes and readers. We plan on working in the Node tomorrow to restow and code a number of locations. Will advise.

0700Christmas morning. Stockings are hung on the ????. Yuri and Sergei surprised with this tradition, but hey, that's what stockings are for. We talk to ??? and give them a "Merry Christmas" also. We get updates on the OCA schedule today-looks like several comm. passes have been added. After the comm. pass we exchange some presents that Santa must have left in the PMA.

0830 Another TV downlink to Moscow for taping. To be broadcast on New Year's Eve. At least no singing on this one. Sergei sends down a quick video tour of station from the camcorder. Russian media interest on "Alpha" activities has been strong all week.

Phone patch with Mr. Goldin on OCA. We try twice-good uplink, but comm. on the return link is intermittent and unreadable. When we break the patch and go to Houston, comm. is back solid. OCA had a busy day-we did at least 6 links today with Houston, Moscow, and the phone patches. Many thanks to the OCA team, GC's and the other folks on the ground who made this work. OCA comm. yesterday with families in Star City was a very positive event, even though the audio quality fell short. We would definitely like to do this again.

The 5A training package introduction arrived onboard in one of the OCA uplinks. We looked at it briefly. This is good material, well laid out, and will save us lots of time when we start focusing on what we should review.

Sergei and Shep have a discussion on how to work the IMAX schedule better for 5A. We don't know how to fit all the requirements into the time available, only that we got well behind on 4A and don't want to be there again. We figure we can setup and shoot faster than we did on 4A, but we estimate at least 45 minutes per shot minimum (for 2 people-not including "talent"). This assumes camera is loaded, and lights and sound equipment all assembled and positioned. When you consider all that goes into one scene-lighting, metering, focus, depth of field, camera moves, rehearsal, clothes, props, sound, etc. we think even this estimate could be short.
If we have a shot that requires moving equipment to another location, as many of them do, then we will need 1 person for something like 80 minutes to move lights and do set ups, and the second person for maybe an hour of that time. So for shooting the 4 scenes in one can, we can easily tie up 2 folks for 4-5 hours. For shooting the 3 cans of IMAX we will have on 5A, we are going to need some very creative thinking on how to get this all done..

In between comm. passes and OCA greetings, everyone got caught up on their email, and all took turns on the TVIS and the IRED as well. Shep finished the Winscat left over from last week's schedule.

We would like to say a few words to the Flight Control Teams-

We were very moved with the presentation this evening by the station's Flight Control Team in Houston. It's pretty humbling to see and talk with a room full of people who have put aside their holidays with family and friends to make sure that we fly safely tonight. Space operations are unique-they demand high performance from just about everything-including people. We are proud to be on this team-and even more infused with a sense of "mission". Thanks to all from your "Alpha" crew.

SHIP'S LOG 23 DEC

Got up at 0730. We are all looking forward to the "three-day weekend", and today is basically an open schedule. We spend the first part of the morning just catching up on email and news of the day.

Yuri is looking for the info sent up this week on loading the map programs on the CPSC hard drive, so he can use this for the earth obs work.

Shep and Sergei work with the bar code reader and the IMS database for about 2 hours. We do some planning as to how the Node barcoding will be done. We inventory all the labels and find we have about 350 spare code labels, and figure that should be enough for now. We do some practice moves and load these in the BCR, and then try batch file transfers on the SSC. It works-data base gets the info. There are some nuances that make it a bit tricky-we had 2 instances of the BCR reader open at the same time, didn't know it, and got the message that the computer could not read the BCR. Both instances were fighting over the comm. port. Just another computer lesson learned. Shep missing his former OS and getting a lot more PC education than he ever wanted, although Sergei is an excellent teacher.
We still have got to come up with an easy way to input data for all the gear and bags that are coded but are not in the data base. We have also got to create codes and data entries for all the soft lockers, PMA 3, Z-1, and several panels in the Node. Sergei suggests that we create some kind of "pile" that we put things in for the ground to help do the detailed data entries. That way, things that appear in the database will have the correct attributes. We're not sure what the most efficient way to do this will be. We are definitely open to any good ideas from the specialists on how to facilitate this.

Yuri and Shep watching Sergei work for more than an hour to load the CD-ROM map package on the CPSD hard drive. We get recurring errors on boot up, and after much troubleshooting, finally decide that some sectors on the drive must be bad. After another spare drive is put in and imaged, it runs OK. The new Ghost software is much more reliable than the earlier version we were using.

Yuri is looking at the map programs-they are usable, but we still think that a high-resolution paper map or atlas will be more handy, particularly when we are looking out the window. We are going to add this to the 5A log request.

We got in some good exercise time on the TVIS and the IRED. We are continually trying to watch the range of motion on the IRED canisters, but it is very easy to overextend the cable. Sergei particularly has limitations with his exercise, as he has more reach than Shep or Yuri.

Reconfigured the Wiener for the DVD drive set up after dinner and tried one of the DVD movies. This is definitely the way to go. Video and sound quality much improved over the CD-ROM disks. Only down-side for us is the network has to come down when the Wiener gets configured for DVD, but we figure for Saturday night, it's worth it.

Everyone secures early as we have several PAO downlinks planned for tomorrow.

SHIP'S LOG 22 DEC

We're up at 0645, getting ready for what promises to be a busy day. We've been waiting for word on moving the OCA back to the Service Module, where it will be much more useful for us. Got the OK last night that we will do it today. Ground also wants to reconfigure the SM TV system and try to send video to the ground today through OCA. We are reading that message and trying to get an overview of what the intended hookup is. Drawing on the last page of the message is kind of simplified, but adds a lot to the big picture.

We start immediately into the changes. Shep is working on pulling cables off OCA and isolating the cable runs in the Node. Sergei and Yuri are behind panels aft of the central post changing cable feeds for the TV system. The downlink "test" of the OCA is scheduled for 4 something p.m. and it sounds like a lot of time, but we are concerned we will be ready.

OCA laptop gets shut down in the Node, and is moved to its original place on the right side of the central post in the SM. Looks good there, although it is right next to CKB-2 which is still condensing way too much water on its piping. We are going to have to fix that sometime later.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 11 lines]

Sergei and Yuri take turns on TVIS before lunch. Apparently ground is taking instrumentation to see if exercise loads affect the motion control systems.

Back into it with OCA. The procedure to connect up the data line calls for us to pull out 2 data lines which run aft the length of the FGB to the ??? and put their aft terminals next to connectors in the ?? so we can check continuity. We leave cables in place and jumper the pins on each end of the cable one at a time to ground and check continuity (and open circuit) that way. Probably saves us 1-2 hours. Also using the scopemeter for this kind of work is sort of overkill. A small test-light probe would do fine here.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 15 lines]

Got the SSC and the OCA with the right hardware plugged in. ???'s on the horn and the ?????? is getting a good picture, but we can't get it up on the OCA. Again, no time to read the steps, all 3 of us pushing keys and moving cables, etc. Finally figured we had to restart to change the video settings on the SSC, and we start getting some frames popping up on the OCA downlink. We get a few more lucky keystrokes, and we have Soyuz video going to the ground.

We break for the day at about 1800, having worked hard to get the video changes done. We were lucky. Any one of maybe 6 or 8 things not done correctly would have disrupted the result, and then figuring out what exactly was out of config would have been a lengthy process. But at least it's working.

Took the rest of the day off, watched the first half of "Blues Brothers", and got on the email.

0644 First comm. pass with ???. We're happy with the new schedule as it looks on form 24. . This will be a big help to get ready for the Progress docking attempt.

0830 Yuri and Sergei test the backup Regul comm. system over a ground site. Checks out OK.

Shep gets the FMK samples from yesterday and starts picking up the Node for PAO's 11:30 downlink.

Approx 0930--Put the CDMK analyzer out and measured CO2 levels for a while in the SM. CDMK put on panel 449 for now. Readings were steady at 0.38 (we think this is percent). Turned the CDMK off to save the batteries, but ready for more readings when requested.

Did a holiday greeting for PAO over the OCA video system. (See below)

Sergei, Yuri, and Shep strip the remaining food items from the used boxes in the pantry (12) and fill the empty containers with sealed food trash bags. These are then taken back to FGB to be restowed until they can be offloaded to Progress. The next group of 12 containers is put in the pantry. We are right on schedule-1 container a day, and we are on #38 right now. (earlier containers had 1+1/3 days packed in them, so containers don't exactly match "days"). We also note that aside from wardroom table ops, this is one of the few activities we have had a chance to do recently (besides eat) that we could all do together.

After lunch, did the periodic medical exams-data logged in the MEC. This is "up" on the net and should be accessible.

Sergei and Yuri complete a cable reconfiguration in FGB to cut off the Russian Segment ??? caution and warning signals to the lab. This is kind of a redundant path, and apparently, the caution and warning exchanges on the data busses are going to be more reliable in this arrangement.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 2 lines]

Tried the procedure for repowering FPP in the Node from UOP 2 on port side. Got the identical fault indication on the UOP when the SSC was powered up. Checked the ground on the laptop, and on the parallel cable-it was OK. Also looked for any floating potential on the cable, but could not find anything out of order. Tried to power up the SSC again. Every time the SSC tried to boot with the parallel cable attached, the UOP tripped off, regardless of whether the NCS box had power or not. Decided to wait and call the ground for some new ideas on this one.

Spent some time trying to download the BCR software upgrade to the rest of the bar code readers. BCR's seem to be quite picky about what files they want to read. Will work on this more tomorrow.

Made our first school radio contact tonight , with Burbank school in Chicago. Took about 10 good questions from students-it was a very successful session.

We also wanted to pass down that we have thoroughly enjoyed, over the past several weeks, talking to the occasional system expert, Flight Director, or computer guru on the comm. links in Houston.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 2 lines]

We would like to close with the text of the PAO downlink passed to Houston today:

As the most "forward deployed" citizens of the planet at this moment, We, the first expedition crew aboard Space Station Alpha, send our holiday greetings to Earth.

We are well started on our journey of exploration and discovery, building a foothold for men and women who will voyage and live in places far away from our home planet. We are opening the gateway to space-for all humankind.

On this night, we would like to share with all-our good fortune on this space adventure; our wonder and excitement as we gaze on the Earth's splendor; and our strong sense---that the human spirit to do, to explore, to discover--has no limit.

We would like to send you our wishes for a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, and the hope-- that our feelings of good will and purpose onboard "Alpha" may enrich the holiday spirit for all---on the good planet Earth.

SHIP'S LOG 20 DEC

0715 Sort of a late wake up for us. First comm. pass at 0740. Looking at the overnight mail and the OCA messages. Front page does not have a link to today's execute package. Only "19 Dec" is visible. This has happened before, but not in the last several weeks. We scan the onboard message file and find all the current messages for today.

Everyone starts the day with the "urolux" routine. Shep gets wrong strip by mistake and has to do it again. It is going to be one of those days.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 18 lines]

Crew takes turns doing the EKG monitoring-Sergei and Yuri on one pass, then Shep on the orbit following. The oscilloscope on the medical cabinet is very sensitive to changes in body position, what you are touching, etc. It's surprisingly easy to mess up the readings, and as Sergei points out, get the chance to do it again.

Talked with ??? about hooking up the video feed from TOPY and feeding it to the ground for the upcoming Progress redock attempt. We think it can be done, but wonder about TV quality on the ground. We would like to move the OCA anyway, so this will be a positive thing if it helps that. We did get the feeling that we should try and avoid detailed technical discussions on the radio without some kind of diagram or technical reference to help communicate better.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 9 lines]

Sergei and Yuri set up the sample gas bottle for the gas analyzer. The manometer gauge on the bottle indicates we are out of test "air". ??? gives a "wait out" on what to do next. We put the gear away.

After lunch, Shep finishes up the SSK sampling. Then spends about 2 hours going through the IMS database, doing updates on gear moves that have been noted but not entered into the database. Some confusion on where the Z1 storage is listed. Database shows it as "outside" Node. IMS is running very sluggishly on SSC 2-don't know why, although some other applications were open (word, explorer). On SSC4, we timed it earlier, and it was 3-4 times slower than on the Wiener. We will keep looking at this. Putting in new bar code information gives rise to lots of questions about how the barcodes and how the database will be managed.

Sergei and Yuri run the vacuum cleaner around the FGB, and make good use of spare time with more stowage and inventory work.

We all knock off at around 1630 for some gym time-TVIS and IRED. Everyone is using the IRED and we all like it. The list of exercises we have "discovered" on it is still growing. We just regret that we could not get at this thing earlier.

Talked to Houston late in the day, and got the good words that planning is going to shift gears to help us organize our stowage and inventory work. We're happy that MCC's are "feeling our pain"-fixing this will really help ops.

714 Up and about as usual for our initial comm. pass.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 6 lines]

Sergei and Yuri are setting up for the Chibis test. We have a long comm. pass and Yuri's going to jump in and see if it pumps down. Ground gets data and Chibis is operational.

Shep looking at TEPC which appears to be hung up in the middle of an "auto restart". Thought we might have had a malfunction here. We check with Houston, and this is an expected indication-which cycles after 30 secs-just did not stare at it long enough. We read TEPC data later and move the detector head to the middle of the SM overhead, panel 327. Troubleshooting the TEPC/MEC computer interface has been deferred.

Sergei and Yuri spend several hours in the morning checking their notes on items in the database against the IMS load on the SSC. Database works OK and things seem to match where we think they should be.

Shep on the TVIS. He and Sergei take a look at the TVIS loading cords as part of the maintenance check. They look OK. Pulling the sleeves down to inspect is still kind of an interesting task. Sleeves are tied up as protection from failure of the loading device. They have to be untied to do the inspection. Finding a knot that will tie two ends of cord to each other, and stay tied in zero g, but is easy to untie has proven challenging. Any marlinspike sailors who want to shine here, speak up.
Also have a short discussion about "critical crack length" on the rubber shock tubes. We think that even a very small flaw will go right to failure on these things, and visual inspection (at least of the rubber part) is probably ineffective. Over to the engineers. TVIS temp data from the maintenance inspection :

Box temp 91.2 Motor temp 96.


After lunch, we have a brief OCA session with the Expedition 2 and 4 crews in Houston. The OCA set up on the Houston end has worse audio quality than we are used to from the front room in MCC---borderline unusable. We pass on that we would have liked some more computer/network training before we left town. We did not realize that keeping all the gear happy up here was going to be quite as complex as it has turned out to be.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 8 lines]

Shep does another check of the portable blood analyzer. It appears that the internal clock has lost power. Waiting for word on the next steps with PCBA.

Removed the starboard UOP from the Node standoff and disconnected its power feed. Standing by for more words on the UOP situation and the RPC trip.

The crew did a 25 minute OCA downlink for CBS, ABC, and NPR radio stations. Most questions were about our plans to celebrate the holidays and what we thought of the Shuttle's schedule changes.

Yuri ran through a check on ?????? microcompressor #2 which was used earlier but pulled when its performance was suspect. He checked resistance of various legs of the pump with the scopemeter. It appears it's a good unit. We're waiting for more words from ground on the results.

Shep dug out the remaining bar code readers and the extra cradle late in the afternoon. We plan on loading all with the software update and using them for tracking gear. If the bar code readers prove useful, we would like to press on putting codes on everything that is unmarked that needs one. Then we would like to audit some key locations to make sure the data base is working. This could be a sizeable job, and we would like to know if IMS and the BCR are going to cut it well before 5A shows up.

We set up the rheostat for the Node mix valve (RAMV)-numbers requested by Houston:
Valve position 14.9 deg. Rheostat 86.2 Knob position - 2 o'clock

We like the proposal in the morning "ops summary" to create a job-jar we can access through Outlook. This is a good idea in that it will use a tool we already have onboard to track these.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 6 lines]

We have a quick huddle on the work plan. Monday, per the schedule, is going to be a busy day. The form 24 contains a few things we have not done before-TVIS test, CMG's, and FPP activation. CMG commanding with the DAT laptop had been briefed to us by the 4A crew, but we had not had the time to do anything more than a quick view of the overall logic. The full procedure runs 60 pages and with several messages for updates-- we are concerned that we will be able to get it all done on time. We did some get-aheads Sunday night, pulling the Node P1 panel off, to look at cable connections and to understand whether we needed to move the SSC laptop used for the CMG controller.

0815 Shep starts the periodic fitness assessment on the TVIS, as the velo is down. Got going on this early to get it out of the way before the CMG work. Test takes about 40 minutes. Have to clear all the files from the "polar" watch and then record and send down the data instead of downlinking it through the MEC, and this adds maybe 30 minutes more. Manually switching speeds on the treadmill is somewhat tricky at higher belt speeds and it is recommended that we find a way to load the test as a profile in the TVIS controller.

Right after the TVIS test, Shep and Sergei start into the CMG procedure. We figure it would be better for 2 people to be familiar with this. Sergei is doing double duty, helping set up the "Chibis" and it instrumentation as well as lending a hand with the CMG commanding. The procedure goes as planned, and we cycle through the 4 CMG's fairly rapidly, send commands, and logging the return data. Timeliners have this laid out for 3 ½ hours total in two sessions, and counting the get-ahead time, Sergei's help, and recording data, we figure this was about right. (thanks planners!)

Yuri and Sergei finish up with the Chibis set up, and ground decides there isn't a long enough pass today to get all the checkout done. It will probably be on the plan for tomorrow.

After lunch, we do a quick tape session for a Russian kids' game-show-"???????a ?? ????". Sergei sends down a short live video tour of the aft part of SM. We wish we had the full "Liv" TV system onboard-it would add a lot to our ability to tape and do reasonably high quality editing. With our limited comm., this would really assist us in getting usable material to the ground. If this stuff shows up on the next Progress or Shuttle, we will definitely make use of it.

Put off the file server backup scheduled for the a.m. as there is too much other stuff going on. Then the OCA plan for uplink/downlink keeps shifting, and we don't want the server tied up with a backup while the ground is trying to access it. Will try and get this in late tonight or first thing in the a.m. Tuesday.

Shep is in the Node, switching power for the Node Comm Unit so we can take more data from the probe on P6. Since the UOP panel on the Starboard side is secured while we troubleshoot, the NCU gets plugged into the Port UOP. Laptop is also powered off of this side. Laptop powers up and starts booting. Shep plugs in the parallel line from the NCU and the UOP trips off with a fault indication. Pretty much the same signature as last week when we could not figure what was wrong with it. Unplugged the parallel cable, and reset the UOP. Laptop (minus the cable) powered up and ran OK. FPP experiment is given the rest of the day off. We're now convinced there's enough weird science between the FPP and the UOP fault detection circuits to keep folks on the ground busy for some time.

Finished the workday with a checkout of the sound level meter. (SLM). Did the internal test, unit passed with -25.8 dB (OK). Did the visual inspection and had trouble identifying the "protective grid". Our meter has a smooth tip which looks like a cylinder. The top surface does have some damage--about a 3mm hole in it, but is otherwise smooth. No grates or slots. We talk to Houston and are standing by for more words.

After dinner, Yuri is trying to load up the CD world map set sent up on 4A. We apparently need to load some "CPSC" software in addition to read the CD's. Any help from the ground on this one would be greatly appreciated.

We're getting ready for our first school radio contact tomorrow, with Burbank School in Chicago. They sent us an email describing their preparations for the comm. pass, and we want to share this with all the troops in the Control Centers who are making "Alpha" work. If you ever had the question-"why a space station?" --this is a pretty eloquent answer:
". . . .Burbank School is a K-8 school in Burbank, a community located on the southwest side of Chicago. Our school has a student population of 700
students.
Since being notified of our ISS contact, our teachers and students have
been very busy with space, space station, and space exploration topics
and activities. Here are just a few things going on at our school.

Our entire school population participated in a school wide art contest
involving the creation of our Burbank School/ ISS mission patch. In
addition, we held auditions for our team of 12 students with 2 back up
students. We ended up with students from a cross-section of classes.
For our questions, we again turned to our students, school wide and were surprised at the quantity and quality of questions received.
If you walked into our school today and wandered down the halls, you
would be surprised at the variety of topics, activities, and displays of
work all centered around the ISS mission. Our school is vibrating with
excitement and activity.
Our first graders have been creating space people and space capsules.
Their themes are "Flying High is Grade One" and "Adventures in Space".
Their bulletin boards reflect the imagination and creativity only a first
grader can have. They even have Winnie the Pooh in a space suit!
As you walk past classrooms, you can hear students and teachers alike
talking about space, shuttles, space stations, and what the latest
information is about the ISS.
Second graders wrote stories about why they would like to be an
astronaut and then made shuttles out of Pringle cans. They colored
pictures of astronauts and put their own photo in the helmets. Some
built space communities of the future and created robots that will
perform city services. They even wrote laws for their community. One of
our classes created the Cosmic Cafe. Menu items include Lift-off
Lemonade, Space Station Steak, and Pluto Pudding.
Students in the middle grades were busy imagining they were astronauts
working on the space station. They wrote their own biographies and
included future missions they world like to be involved with. They
tracked the ISS on the web and plotted on a map where the space stationwas every 45 minutes. They wrote time lines comparing our school day to the ISS. Other children wrote poems and made chalk drawings to accompany their poems.
To prepare for our ISS contact, the junior high students searched the
web for information on the space station. After much discussion, the
students created power point presentations. They made a ten-slide show, which consisted of one slide telling what the ISS is, one slide for the astronaut, and one for each cosmonaut on the ISS, the remaining slides contained information about space and the space station. Students are prepared to present this to our audience on the day of the contact. The power point work was done by our Special Education students in junior high.
Other junior high classes worked on creating a NASA time line. In Math,
students used the distance formula to calculate the ISS' distance from us
here in Burbank. This was done over a period of several days so students understood the idea that it was moving constantly.
In addition to measuring distance, students also considered time. They
thought about their own future and where they would be in the year 2030.
By then we will need a new ISS, so some of our future engineers decided to design and build the space station of the year 2030. They not only built the model, they also wrote a paper describing how and where it
will be built. Our more artistic students decided they would be
scientists on the new space station. They proposed that they were
assigned to gather information using a new high powered telescope. They then used their creativity and imagination to draw what they saw when they looked through the telescope. Some of our students are very
interested in the environment. They decided they would research and
write a paper describing a particular man-made Earth pollution problem.
They then would develop a plan for solving the problem using the
technology of the space station.
All classes spent time using many of the websites that Charlie Sufana
shared with us. As our students continued their search, one site led to
another and their enthusiasm grew proportionately.
We here at Burbank School are ready.----OVER...."

0710 Up and about. Saturday morning. Fortunately, a "rest" day. We are ready for some time off. Looking for coffee. Already drank all the coffee that 4A brought up, but going to order a bunch more on 5A when the lab comes. We root around through the chow boxes and find some more. "Alpha" really needs a "coffee-barka" (translation-coffee locker) somewhere onboard.

Spent some time organizing all the message traffic. We have a regular message board-make that 2 message boards (one OCA, one Radiograms). We try and save whatever paper copies we print instead of printing new ones so we don't use more paper. If stuff gets really old, it goes back through the printer. Got some words from Houston how to sort and search the "messages" page, and this is really useful info-Thanks!!

Checked the Z-1 hatch and the PMA-3 hatch somewhat later-Houston requests that the MPEV 's stay open---we agree, as we have noted some small pressure differences across both hatches when we open the valves. Gave a quick look inside PMA 3-nice and dry. Hull was moderately warm to the touch-maybe 70 degrees. Closed the hatch.

Tweaked the port antenna cables for Early Comm at MCC request and CATO got happy with comm. again.

Sergei and Yuri browsing the IMS database on the SSC-client machines can access, but they load slowly--90 seconds or so. SSC locked up a few times on Sergei-he's going to have more words on this soon.

??? changes caution and warning limits for the cabin pressure sensing and we get false warning alarms. We joke with ??? about it.

The crew gets the toolbags out and "turns to" on the wardroom table. Work has been at a standstill since Progress left. We spend half of the morning and most of the afternoon on it. Lots of raw material left over from stowage frames on Progress. Just finding something that is suitable is most of the battle. Mounted the second ??? box and otherwise made good headway on the table layout. It is turning into an excellent "team" project. About 1600 we stow the parts and tools and knock off for some exercise.

Everyone takes a turn on the TVIS, and we all get a light workout in on the IRED. Our adaptation to IRED is still taking time, as every session, we rig something a bit different, change clips or settings. The workout routine is just not settled out yet, and as a result, we have only done about 50% of the exercise taping requested.

Finish the day with dinner and the last disk of "Contact".

Shep's day started badly. Lost favorite mechanical pencil. Probably pulled out of its belt pouch by velcro and stuck somewhere. List of things unaccounted for onboard is, however, surprisingly low. Black sharpie markers seem to have unique capability to avoid detection. Most everything else turns up after a while in a filter somewhere.

First thing this a.m. is loading the IMS software on the server. Server gives us an unexpected message about a file deletion. We check with the ground and then continue. SSC server now has the IMS load, and we can access it from client machines. OCA 255 complete.

Getting ready to swap an RPCM in the Node. One unit has a firmware problem-ground wants to replace it. Not sure whose data is right as to where the spare is-our data base does not agree with what's sent up to us. We pulled a spare RPCM from a different Node stowage location and put in the Z-1 standoff two days ago. Check the Node stowage labels against the message, and yes, the required spare is up in the overhead. Undo the IRED, pull the support braces off, and move the IRED platform down out of the way. Open the Z-1 hatch and pull out the RPCM. Put the IRED back in place and torque everything down. Getting RPCM in hand takes about an hour.
Sergei and Shep pull off the closeout panel and access the installed RPCM. Again, pictures are very useful in the procedure. RPCM changeout straightforward. Talk to Moscow who relays to Houston we are go for powerup. Planned timeline for this one was 40 minutes-not counting the RPCM hunt, probably needed an extra 20 minutes just to clear the stowage off of the panel.

Sergei and Shep check the 2 acoustic dosimeters we have onboard. Started individual monitoring last night. Measuring parameter is "Lav" (average) Readings were low, and are still low today--Sergei's in the high 20's and Shep's about 35 dB. Talk to the ground and we're discussing troubleshooting. These units just came up on 4A, and batteries were not changed out-battery readout indicates OK for the whole measurement period. We turned the units off.

Yuri finished the workday installing the control unit for Chibis. We get a reprieve on Chibis ops until Monday.

All hands took a turn alternating between TVIS and the weight room. Still learning what to do and how to do it on IRED. We come up with something new every time we are on it.

We are up early for the first comm. Lots of activity in the Node has been deleted from the schedule because we may not have a working power panel. The UOP trouble shooting will be done first. We kind of expected that CMG and other activities would have to wait until we got the UOP panel in a reliable configuration. Shep did the procedure sent by OCA in detail, and the UOP "cured" itself. Previous dropouts did not reoccur and we could not repeat the same failures from yesterday. Hooked up SSC 3 to the UOP outlet and it is running fine.

Sergei and Yuri start the day by changing out a ???? battery controller, and some instrumentation equipment.

Shep finishes the IRED cal. Numbers to follow. One canister has about 10% more resistance at low ranges, and this difference increases at the top of its load setting.

Yuri and Sergei working on the velo, with ground receiving instrumentation, and doing some troubleshooting. Still no resolution on what is wrong with the velo. We have the scopemeter warmed up and the pin kit ready. Just waiting on a circuit diagram and a short test procedure.

Finished the morning with a 25 minute CNN interview over OCA. Voice quality on the station end was adequate. No data dropouts and the downlink went well-performance of OCA now appears acceptable to support more of this.

Discussion with ground about the condensate drain line for the CKB airconditioning system. Apparently it is not putting out the expected amount of water. Ground thinks a valve may be out of configuration, but we check and feel that it has to be something else. We're standing by for more comprehensive testing tomorrow.

Shep got a run in on TVIS-operating normally.

After lunch, Shep entered some changes to SODF and continued stowage and clean-up in the Node.

Yuri and Sergei successfully installed and tested a new hand controller in the Soyuz living compartment (??) This is used for manual maneuvering during docking.

We got up with the usual "privet" with TsUP. First thing this a.m. is a calibration of the CSA-CP gas analyzers to verify the high readings yesterday afternoon. Calibrated both units and the readings are normal.

We were trying to finish storing and closing out PMA 3, but could not find the vent duct cap for the line which connects station and the ODS. Asked Houston about it-they said to make up a cap from something. Line is an intake to a cabin fan, so the cap has to be somewhat rigid. Took out the clamp and bracket kit and made a new vent cap from .030" aluminum. Shears and sheet metal pliers made this a straightforward task. Put the cap on the end of the duct. Loaded the PMA with gear that we don't plan on seeing again until 5A and closed the hatch. Shep thinking about asking for small machine tools to be sent up.

Sergei and Yuri are looking at installations of the ?? sensors for leak detection. These are fitted around hatches to indicate airflow during small leaks. They look like hot-wire anemometers. We are not sure how well they will work. We didn't put them on the hatches aft to the Soyuz, as this is the first place we will go and leak check regardless of the indicated data. Got several of the sensors up and checking the wiring connections.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 29 lines]

Try to get started on the IRED calibration. We pulled a cable out a bit too far last night seeing what exercises we could do with IRED, and one canister is now making some "clicking" sound. We pull the canister up and open the bottom up, and the thimble on the end of the lanyard is a bit out of position. Believe it's rubbing the cover so we reset it and put the canister back. Works smoothly. got the calibration going but could not finish it with the troubleshooting for UOP's going on. Will complete this tomorrow. So far, the calibration looks pretty linear, except that one can is about 10% stronger than the other. We plan on just putting up a strip of tape marked with approximate loads anyway. Most of the rest of the activites scheduled in the Node for today are moved later.

Finish the day with an OCA video call from Houston with Precourt and Foale. Word is that we may be able to videocon from Russia for spouses-- this will be great.

Got to secure from the comm. gear about 2100 and watched the last disk of "Private Ryan".

Kind of a frustrating day, but enjoying the aspect of having plenty of time to fix this stuff later. Reminded of the Civil War story at Pittsburg Landing. Union troops start the battle with heavy losses, Sherman tells Grant that they had had the "devil's own day." Grant replies: "Yep. . . lick 'em tomorrow, though"

Houston has some words about reconfiguring the valves and ducts in PMA 3. Should be easy

Put away IMAX. Lots of gear, lights, wires, etc. Got it all stowed in the Node soft racks in one area, but the soft rack locker is definitely "full". After a popped zipper, learned the hard way that you can't stuff these as hard as the rigid lockers-got to be a bit more careful.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 25 lines]

Everyone takes a run on TVIS. Sergei tries the Velo-ergometer again. It is still stuck at max resistance.

Shep looking at exercise positions on the IRED. Shep and Sergei try squats, dead lift, rowing, bench press, military press. All are very workable and we like the feel of the gear. Width between canisters could be bigger-that's probably the biggest design issue now. Tried a position to get some crunches in, and we think that is going to work well also. Shot a fair amount of video on the DV cam. We can send files to the ground on this through OCA if desired. The weight room is open on Alpha.

Sergei spends about 1 ½ hour in the late afternoon troubleshooting the Russian acoustic meter-the spectrum display shows a strong signal at about 40 hertz (est.) and then lower noise until several hundred Hz. We are wondering what this is-CKB?

We finish up having had a good workday. Pace was excellent. Mood of the crew excellent. Ground kept us informed, but we did not feel rushed. Made good progress in the Node and PMA 3 with stowage and inventory. We should be pretty much done in there with one more good workday.

Rest day. We are catching up on email and other personal stuff.

Spent some time in the Node cleaning up so we could start setting up the IRED. Took about 2 hours lining it up so that it is square and turnbuckles have enough "thread" with uniform load. Finally get the base plate happy and work with the canisters. Plate is extremely rigid and we are pleased with that. We get RED fully assembled, Shep goes for a quick spin. Everything seems to work OK, although first impression is that this thing is going to need higher resistive load. More data tomorrow.

Everyone gets some exercise on TVIS. Velo has a control problem-we have lost the electronic interface to the display box which shows data and changes the load. Unfortunately, load is stuck at the maximum value. We are thinking something is loose inside, but we need some expert help to try and resolve. Will wait to talk to the ground tomorrow about what is next. We'd like to get some kind of electrical diagram so we can troubleshoot, but Velo may be out of commission.

Went thru the ship with the vacuum cleaner-pulled all the debris out of filters and intakes. It is amazing-if you ever let loose of something, there is an almost 100% chance it is going to end up in a filter or screen somewhere. So far, we have not "lost" anything important, except maybe some "1"s and "0"s in the IMS database.

We spend several more hours just picking up wires, data file, parts, etc. scattered about. Lots of camera gear and transfer items still to be organized. Start with the IMAX--camera stowed.

Sergei and Shep talking about how to barcode things we don't havebarcodes on. We want to get knowledge down to small items as to exactly where they are. We will have to generate new codes and we're not completely sure how we do it.


Several videocons in the afternoon on OCA. Quality is good. Have not had any recurrence of intermittent voice/audio since we changed out machines.

Started laying out the IRED platform and parts in the early evening. Didn't realize we had procedures onboard for this, as they were not in the "Activation" section of the MED OPS book.

Shep starting to put notches in the large vise grips. Used them again today to loosen the vacuum jumper line from the MPEV valve. Even though the hose says hand tighten only-doesn't mean you won't need a tool to get it off. Just think it should be SOP on station that we have tools for every fitting we are expected to work with.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 34 lines]

We set up the quarterdeck with video and rehearse quickly how we open the hatch. Brent and crew do all the PMA 3 config, which is a real lifesafer to us.
Brent and crew come into view and we do the arrival honors. It does feel a lot more like a ceremony than the handshake across the hatch. We're glad we got to do it. A few minutes of saying hello on the quarterdeck, and then it's off to Endeavour to see the arrays. Going back through the hatches-we have the sensation of being in a smaller and more cramped environment. Station is getting spacious with the long hatchway fore and aft, and pretty big volume in the Node. It's a real contrast. We check out the arrays-they look too frail to be so large-but they're working. Also surprised at how close the orbiter is to the PMA-we are right on top of it out the AFD window.

Back inside the station for a quick safety brief. Location of O2 masks and some other safety items. Quick tour of FGB and Service Module. We all gather around the central post so Shep can brief the joint ops. Brent and crew have offered to pitch in to cover all the FD 09 activites. So we pair up and give folks the procedures, tools, and get out of the way.
Sergei and Joe T tackle the IMAX. Joe looks at the magazine and it checks OK . When the camera is reloaded, we finally get it to arm and run. So Joe and Sergei start setting up for shots.

Mark and Yuri are working the gear transfer. Most of the big stuff is ready to go, but the inevitable confusion about the small things. Lots of back and forth to Houston about the details.

Carlos is tackling the FPP data set up. Shep helping with CBCS, IMAX, and gear transfer. We are all scooting around at 60 miles an hour and we still can't stay ahead of the schedule. Houston says to delete IWIS from the plan. We are thankful.

Carlos trying to load the SSC upgrade for the FPP experiment. No go. He spends about 3 hours on this and finally gets it to load after multiple tries. This very consistent with our earlier SSC experience-and one of the big reasons we try to minimize computer reconfigurations.

Carlos and Shep work on the CMG/DAT laptop fam session. The run through is fairly straightforward, but still takes twice as long as scheduled.

We take about 45 minutes out for dinner with the Endeavour crew.
We have the first IMAX shot ready in the wardroom-trying to get a group shot with everyone around the table. Set up drags on and Brent has to cover something with Houston and can't make it. But we get our first IMAX take.

After chow, everyone back to their "post" and we continue to work the schedule.
Another check with CBCS-all looks good. FPP is getting data and that looks good also. Cargo transfer complete, except for a few small last minute items.

Back in the SM for a quick group photo shoot. Goes well, several cameras and camcorders on line.

Shep, Sergei, Yuri, and Joe T. back on IMAX. We set up and shoot the rest of the first roll. We wrap IMAX up at 0300. Joe offers to load mag 2 which is a huge help. We finally go lights out around 0400.

SAT 09 DEC

800 Back at it to try and get some more IMAX in the can.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 20 lines]

Need to be ready for the PMA leak check. Scopemeter is handy, but it is out of battery power. Have to dig for the new batteries. Yuri finds the "D" cells, but the scopemeter needs "C" s. These just came aboard with 4A but we have them temp stowed someplace strange. Finally locate them but can't find all the vacuum access line gear. Finally locate that and Carlos sets up the pressure test gear and this checks out-about 15 minutes before we think we will need it.

Hatch closure. Just under the bell. PAO has TV going down, so we do a live "departure". Seems to go well. We are sorry to see the Endeavour crew depart-worked really hard and actually enjoyed that to some degree, but had zero down time together.

Went through the undock procedure and watched the fly around. Then signed off as Endeavour backed away. We are sorry to see the crew depart but are real glad we had their help to get through the 24 hours of joint ops. We could not have done it without them.

Up early to talk to ??? about the plan of the day.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 56 lines]

Got the word late in the evening that ground is happy with the CKB 2 performance, and humidity control in the Node is no longer an issue. We have a go to open the hatch on the Node at will. This is great news and we go into the Node for some more packing and rigging until late. Finally have some room to spread out the gear, and clear a path thru FGB.

Finished a real long day with the ?????? back on line. Got more parts to fix it if need be, so we're happy with that. CKB 2 is up-noisy like # 1 was. From the system standpoint we are back in business. Just have to get moving on the schedule for the rest of the docked period to see what we can make happen.

One thing that we think would help everyone would be if ground could give us more of the technical nuts and bolts of what is going on. We thought we saw CKB -1 "slugging" as it was initially operating several weeks back. It was vibrating heavily which seemed unusual. And the news that specialists were unhappy with it this week caught us by surprise. (we thought it sounded better). The impact to our week has been real strong. It would be nice to be able to know more about what the technical folks are thinking, and perhaps our insight into what we are seeing will help them figure out what the station is doing.

0605 Up for the first comm pass. Say hello to Sergei G. and look for some hot water. Everyone's real happy that we got a bag full of instant coffee and tea drinks from 4A. We are wondering if we should put another order in for 5A.

Sergei and Yuri still having some email problems. Apparently friends in Russia do not have the right email address to reach them.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 1 line]

Talk to Houston. 4B array is looking good. Everything working well. Some details for us-notes on Node ingress, and a TVIS test this a.m. to see if it can handle faster speeds.

??? has Sergei and Yuri started on a bag full of instrumentation sensors for FGB. They get right on it and spend most of the morning diving behind panels. Lots of fine-work, small markings, long serial numbers, tight access.

Shep on TVIS for the test. Tried all the pc flash cards in the MEC before the data take to see which ones were useable. MEC could not read any of them and 2 of the cards crashed the computer. Same symptoms as before. Ran the TVIS schedule with pc cards anyway. (FE-1 for Shep. Sergei ran later with "spare" card). Noticed that the static buildup discharges when you touch the control panel and blanks the screen display. Happened twice. Also disabled the keyboard entry. But treadmill kept on running. Max speed on the treadmill was 14 km/hr. Video documentation to be shipped down on 4A. Sergei does the same test in the afternoon.

Shep changes out the PCS laptop for a new one which came up on 4A. It runs normally. Also reorganized all the SODF and bagged up the stuff for return to Houston.

Called down to CAPCOM about the logistics plan for 4A gear transfer. We received OCA 431 and this very helpful in figuring out what we need to do. It's a much more integrated plan than the bits and pieces we were working off of earlier. (ought to put this one in the CAPCOM notebook as a model of how to do it.)

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 11 lines]

Mid afternoon, Sergei and Shep spend well over an hour going over the ingress and patch panel details. We find the EPS training drawings to be extraordinarily useful. (Thanks, Bart and Lee). The before and after patch panel config is clearly laid out and although the procedure is 29 pages long, we think we know what our part is about. We are hunting down tools and ziplock bags, tape, connector pliers. Ready to go maybe 1 ½ hours early, which is good because Houston calls and says to get on with it. So Sergei starts to equalize the pressure on the KBD valve, and we're in the PMA and Node in about 5 minutes. Port panel over the patch panel is already off and stowed. We take out the deck panel-this is a 60 second job for the Makita. Check the connectors against the procedure and we're ready.
Back to the central post to standby for a go.

The EVA'ers are rolling and we are trying to stay ahead of the timeline. Houston calls the RACU power off and Sergei and Shep back inside the Node to do the connector swap. Night ops-all the Node lighting powered down. Shep's reading and holding the light--Sergei's doing. Very quick work and we're back out to wait for the next panel. We standby the central post as Houston goes through the rest of the reconfig.. Finally get the call that we're ready-- the second RACU is powered down. We're just finishing up the laptop bus swap, and Endeavor's already on the loop saying that Carlos and Joe have their side done. We are thinking those guys must have had their connectors already half threaded-we are sandbagged. We get in the Node and finish the deck panel. We put up the covers, check the drying fans and depart. Houston's pressing on and the rest of the procedure is configuration clean up. Node running on P6 power.

More listening in on A/G 2 as Endeavour and Houston tag up. EVA is going well.

Discussion with ??? about the plan for Wednesday-still under discussion. Specialists want us to do CKB airconditioner installation. We don't know how time critical this is, but we have a lot on our plate to be ready for Friday-and we need some time to get our gear organized. Talk to Houston some more and standing by to see the plan in the a.m.

LOG NOTES FROM O3 DEC ( ENTRY INTO NODE 1):

0715 Organizing the notes to do the ingress. Several different OCA messages, 2 procedures, tools. More tools for contingencies. Putting it all together for something which can be executed in 30 mins looks like a real stretch. Told CAPCOM that-ground agrees and OK's being in the Node 1 hr.

0800 Started pressure equalization procedure. Crew getting instruction from ??? and Houston virtually simo. This worked out OK in this instance, but we really need to watch this-has the potential, with every good intent, to do something bad. Sergei and Shep getting the big picture and sorting out what we are doing-need maybe 20-30 minutes just to feel like we know what everyone's doing. We ask if there is a time crunch to get ingress started on time. Houston says no, so we take a couple more moments making sure that we don't forget something essential.

PMA is equalizing. Takes a lot longer to settle out than we expected. Maybe 20 minutes or more. Houston has the IMV open so Node and PMA end up at the same pressure. Sergei opens the APAS hatch, goes into the PMA and opens the Node hatch. Lights are on. Node is spacious. A little cool, but not uncomfortable. Shep in shorts and a long shirt and feels OK. Node seems very dry. Hardly any velcro anywhere-we need to put some down when we get in on a permanent basis. Kind of swimming around, as we are used to much tighter quarters in the SM and FGB.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 13 lines]

Sergei pulls out the Endeavour cargo and we start moving it into the FGB. Lots more volume in the gear transfer than we thought. FGB deck is full of bags again, for the 3rd time this flight. We close the PMA 3 hatch and the equalization valve. Shep in the Node pulling out other IMAX bags we need. Yuri finishes putting in the portable fans. We can't find the new dessicant bags and procedure is kind of convoluted about this. Decide to get out of the Node, close the ?? hatch and talk to Houston. Houston points us to the right location-we're back in and bags are there in a pile of plastic wrappers. We do a quick bag swap. New dessicant bags are wrapped like they are going to Mars and back. Plastic bags over the dessicant are tough to get off. SEAL knives are out. Bags are on the fans and we're out of the Node-just over an hour total time inside.

We secure the gear bags to the deck in FGB, and start going through what we have. We take a couple of minutes to open the crew care package and all the goodies. Sergei and Yuri are happy to get mail. Shep is very happy with large pliers and new tool bits for the power tools. Plus all the other stuff on our "quick turnaround" logistics list. It's kind of like Christmas, early. Thanks guys!


04 DEC

Got up and got the word first EVA was successful. Some problems extending array 2B. 4B still in the box waiting for analysis of what the other wing did on deploy, But we're making power and that's the good news.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 16 lines]

BME's-we still love you.

Sergei starts wiring up some BITS instrumentation in FGB, and Yuri doing the same in the aft part of SM. Ground needs to check the connections over comm passes.

Shep waiting to get a run in on TVIS-but have to hold up and stay out of Yuri's way and help where possible. Setting up the TVIS. Called down to Houston that the large vise grips were used for the first time on Alpha at GMT 11:16:30-- to tighten the SPD arms on the TVIS treadmill. Knobs keep backing off, and the vise grips are used to put some more torque on them.
Got a 20 min. run in at moderate speed. Did have an interesting anomaly with the control display. Treadmill was cranking away at 7 km/hr and somehow the screen displays went blank on the control panel. Keypad was unresponsive. "system pause" would not work either. Treadmill is running as before. Tried the "emergency stop" magnet and that was functional. Stopped the treadmill, powered down, started up, and finished the session with normal indications. We think we have seen this once before on TVIS.

Yuri puts in the new compressor for ??????. Yuri and Sergei keep installing equipment through the afternoon-mostly BITS telemetry boxes.

Sergei puts the new hard drive in the Russian laptop, and our RS displays are back up. Although we have the CD-ROM image disk for the Russian software load, it's not exactly clear how we are supposed to image another hard drive for the laptop. ( we need to do this for a backup capability). ??? says later that we can use the US SSC autoloader floppy for this, but we would feel better if we had a procedure-that someone on the ground had checked first.

Shep worked on gathering all the IMAX gear. Assembled and checked out the camera. All works. Battery is fully charged. Switches off. Going to check all the floodlight equipment tomorrow and maybe tackle the film loading.

Finished the day with a quick "how is it going" TV downlink to Russian ground sites. We are staying busy, and with the Node ingress, IWIS, gear moves, etc. we will find plenty more to do.

SHIP'S LOG 02 NOV


Up at 0630 for first comm pass. Everything looking normal for docking evolution with Endeavour.

Everyone at a laptop to read mail and sort through the message traffic. We all are seeing some problems. Sergei moved all his mail to a personal folder, yet his ".ost" file is still over 1 Mb. Shep can't run outlook at all on the MEC configured with the SSC 2 hard disk. Yuri is having trouble doing mail in Russian. He needs help on fonts. We feel pretty much like a bunch of campers when it comes to mail-server problems. A little more of the nuts and bolts of how this all works would be useful to us and could help us work better with the ground during troubleshooting sessions.

Questions from the ground if we can verify ??? running. This is a fan in the general location of the other fans on the CKB unit which had damage. We can't hear it, and ground does not have telemetry that says it is working. We are wondering if they share the same ducting.

Sergei and Yuri do a cable configuration in SM to get ready for 120 volt P6 power.

Pressure equalization for the Node is put off until tomorrow. Node temps are too low. (4 C.)

Clean up the ship--wipe down rags and the vacuum are out. General pick up of loose stuff. SM looking shipshape. Very few gear bags about--only computer bags and photo bags still out. Everything else stowed.

Shep on the TVIS, followed by Sergei. Trying to get exercise in early today, as the afternoon may be busy. Set up is getting to be routine. We are cranking up the TVIS and then by the time we get changed and gear on, everything is up to speed and ready to go. Setup and shut down time (together) is less than 10 minutes now.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 13 lines]

1710 Tried the first VHF comm with Endeavour. No joy. CAPCOM came up later on OCA and said Endeavour was receiving. We try again, and get very weak but readable comm. Comm stays poor through the whole docking event.

We get a visual on Endeavour in trail, about 5-8 km out in very bright light. Approach smooth across the R-bar under us. View looking down on the orbiter is very unreal--more like a model than a 100 ton object--you just can't put a sense of scale to it.
First time we have seen the tail forward maneuver. Orbiter looks like it's in pure rotation--very slow right turn. Tail forward, and Endeavor is about 250 feet below right as we lose daylight. "170 foot" calls exchanged. "Romeo at the dip." ( translation: receiving ship is ready for maneuvering ship to begin approach. ) Endeavor asks about solar array position, but we can't verify without RS laptop. We ask Endeavour to check with Houston.
Calls from Endeavour close in are very helpful to alert us to initial capture and docking motions. Felt and heard a very slight bump as contact was called. "Capture long" and "arrival" indications came up immediately on PCS. "Drift" for Russian Segment and the LED state took a few seconds longer but both OK. Rest of the docking sequence felt very smooth.

Sergei and Yuri downlink some highlights of the docking we shot with the PAL video camera to Russian ground sites. We float around the wardroom looking for some more food, talking about the docking, and what we will find in the Node tomorrow.

Woke up to the news that our solar panels are on the way. Thanks for the good work, launch team!

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 5 lines]

SSC 2 is having trouble opening links up on the execute package. This is from a cold boot up with nothing else going on. Problem has been intermittent, although it has been worse for the last two days.

Sergei, Yuri do TV test of ??????. Video picture looks clear.

Sergei, Yuri, Shep looking at CKB-2 fans. Both have damage. BT fan has superficial blade nicks, but obviously something flew through it. BTK has 3 blades broken off. One blade is jammed in the housing. Still looking for the other 2 Duct diagram would be nice. Ask ??? about this, and we get an uplink file from Houston later--thanks guys!!
Did a quick motor test, both fan motors turn and sound OK. We think we can swap out the fan with the broken blades--although it's an all-day job.

Shep worked on TEPC data transfer, so we could turn TEPC on and let it log some more data. Configured MEC so that comm 1 was enabled. Tried to get MEC and TEPC to talk several times. TEPC was started in "off" position per procedure. Still no joy. No data to MEC. Relocated TEPC on SM 248 and powered it up.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 19 lines]

CKB installation. Yuri and Sergei work this most of the morning and all afternoon. Installation task is right on top of the central post, and OCA has to be moved out of the way to avoid damage. Still, working with heavy stuff and high loads right over all the computer and network gear is a risk. Nothing gets damaged, but lots of potential for a misstep or impact on something important.
Fit of heat exchanger unit is very tight. We are saying bad things about the engineers. Sergei is sure the unit has been fit-checked on the ground. You can see bright marks where parts were binding together, though. Files, silicon lube, hammers, pry bar, line up tool all in the fight. Finally have to loosen the support bolts for the whole airconditioning unit to float it a little bit and get enough space to slide the heat exchanger in. Could have used the "large vise grips" at least twice, and a 1/4" die-grinder would have been real handy. Told ??? that so they would sense this was not your ordinary "bolt it down" job. More like changing out your transmission. Finally got it together about 25 minutes before the undocking.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 2 lines]

Minor flail trying to find the 4A hard drive which came up on Progress, which has the new software load for 4A. Shep goes through all the computer bags. Finally find the drive at the central post under the ePCS.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 17 lines]

1615 Undock of Progress. All the critical stuff is done on Progress' internal algorithms. Yuri's at the ???? control panel ready to intervene. The release is smooth and straight away. "Progress, . . . departing"

Sergei is shooting out the large nadir window with the laser rangefinder. Progress does a backoff pulse and flies below us, going slightly behind. As Progress gets lower it comes into the sunlight and and crosses underneath to the port side aft, well away from station.

After the undock, Shep hooks up the 4A PCS to the central post. Unfortunately, can't find the means to power up the PCS socket for GNC 1 bus. GNC 2 is easy, as that has a tumbler switch on the ??? panel. Talk to ??? about this one, and ask if we have a drawing onboard which might show what powers these sockets. (Don't think we do.) More on this one tomorrow. For right now, 4A PCS is on GNC-2.

We finish up having a look over the form 24 for docking day with Endeavour, We decide we have had a pretty good day, having used all the power tools, hammer, files, 1/2 of the other hand tools, COSS reference library, and schematic drawings all in the same day.

Periodic health checks today. We are starting to track the things that we think we have done for the last time and we put this near the top of the list.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 5 lines]

Sergei and Yuri spend considerable time downloading the sound meter data to Russian laptop 3. The laptop has a modem for the Regul comm. link, and this is about twice as fast as the packet data transfer on the ??? radio. This will probably become the prime data channel up to the SSC network on the Russian side.

TEPC data recorded and listed in the data section below.

1042 FPP checked as requested and is receiving data normally.

TVIS checks are normal. Electric box temps 92.4, motor temp is 88.0. Thanks to the BME's for all the info on the TVIS issues. We are using the wrist bracelet rigged backwards as a means to provide grounding. The alligator clip is attatched to clothing, and the wrist strap is on the bottom of the TVIS control panel. This prevents the grounding wire from interfering with running motion on the treadmill. As an interim solution for the static charge build up, this is working.

At 1350 we do a PAO downlink with 2 media contacts. Lots of questions about our long term habitability and general adaptation to lengthy space missions. As we were getting ready for the event, we did ask Capcom and PAO whether we should be ISS or "Alpha" on one of the presentations. We would like to suggest the following as a working solution:

Orbital station and crew on station = " Alpha"

International partnership to build the station = "International Space Station"


Shep and Sergei do the BP/ECG check-Sergei is the operator and Shep the subject. We hook up the ECG to the MEC computer and everything is run per the steps in OCA 1107. We have good traces on the ECG and the MEC seems to handshake OK on its RS 232 bus. The program runs as expected on the MEC. Just as a check, we look at the size of the data file written by the program and it appears to be Zero K. We don't think there is any data recorded-If ground could look at this and advise, please.

We took a look at the IWIS rigging again today, with an eye to a permanent location. Lead #4 from the port hatch area does not have enough length to reach the RSU 2 unit in its nominal position anyway, so we are going to have to do something. We talk with Houston and we are going to try the RSU shifted to the portside about 3 feet. We think all the lead wires will be OK and this is to be tested tomorrow.

Finshed the day with some gym time, chow, and reel 1 of "Lion of the Desert".

0720 We are in contact with Moscow. Changes to the big plan today. Everyone agrees we don't need to unload PMA3 right now-just need the IWIS gear out. There are still questions about whether we can power the MACE experiment with the FPP data being taken simultaneously.

We are REALLY liking the 8 O'Clock report. This should help streamline some of the stuff in the Daily Summary also. We notice the proposal in the summary to do the 8 O'Clock and the Daily Summary together with Moscow. Can a joint Mars mission be far off?

We have the monthly body mass measurement this a.m. and the lower leg volume measurement. All the data looks very consistent. Sergei is doing a lot of photo documentation to provide for updates for some of the photos in the procedures.

Shep and Yuri update the file server with service pack 7. No problems. We reboot the server and it runs well all day.

We get the IWIS bag out of PMA 3. Of course, it is in the bottom of the PMA. Knowing the barcode is a very helpful addition to the info from the ground, except that the IWIS bag is one of the few left that we have not marked so it can be read from a distance. But by process of elimination, we figure it is the bottom bag, and this proves to be true. Getting this out and restowing what was removed takes maybe 15 minutes.

Shep does the monthly treadmill test (PFE). Data is being sent to the CheCS folder. Sergei and Yuri are changing the ??? hose and this normally would have been a schedule conflict (we are all in the same space), but we saw this coming and the job was done early.

We have a school contact by ham radio right before lunch. Very clear contact with George West School in Texas. We got to answer 20+ questions on the pass, and they all were excellent.

We get the word from Houston that MACE will have to standby until the FPP experiment data has been collected. No MACE for the day. This works out OK for us, as we now have a chance to get into Z1 and pull out gear we will need for 5A. We take the IRED down, and open the Z1 hatch. We locate the "portable fan" half-CTB and pull it out. Putting the IRED back, one of the short rod assemblies (turnbuckles) gets bound up. The "banjo" end fitting has about 5 threads to go but the turnbuckle sleeve is seized tight to the threads on the "short" end. Threads are shiny, and maybe it's just that tolerances on the threads are too tight. We put 80+ foot lbs on the turnbuckle body with no load on the long end, and it won't move in either direction. We are going to need a replacement piece at some point. Part number 46117199-302, S/N 1007.

Sergei and Yuri get to take more data with the "Shumomer" (sound level meter) which is fast becoming our most fun thing to do. Sergei and Yuri also get laptop 3 rigged in the large diameter of Service Module, and this involves an extensive redo of the ethernet cabling. This, however, is a good excuse to clean up the network layout a bit, and now the "Y" legs in the wiring are gone and we have one continuous backbone for the SM subnet. Almost all of the cabling is behind panels or in the 1" wire trays, and if anything, it looks too good. Crews will wonder for a long time what we were complaining about regarding the planning and integration of laptop locations.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 7 lines]

We try to get ??? to redesignate the new (combined) form 14-23 as "form 14-23K". (Krikalev). They don't bite.

Although the activities of the day were not exactly as planned, we got a lot done. Every night now we gather around the wardroom table and talk about all the things we would like to finish before Exp 2 shows up. Now if we could just clean up IMS. . .

We watch the end of "End of Days" and regret that we did not roll it on New Year's Eve.

0700 Comm with Moscow. We discuss the day's plans and talk about an OCA window to pass down some words on the "Challenger" anniversary.

We have been working with the Timex software. Many thanks to the folks who got this up to us. It seems we each have a different version of the datalink watch, and of course, the software is different with each. Yuri and Sergei are able to load up a day's worth of alarms, but Shep has the Datalink 150, and this has a 5 alarm limit. So 2/3 of the crew are now happy. All this is a pretty good argument for training like you are going to fly-we should have caught this one ourselves in our training work on the ground.

Shep changes out the one harness cord on IRED. The cord which was used previously and repaired will be sent down on 5A for inspection and engineering entertainment.

We change out the TVIS series bungee system as part of the monthly inspection. We have all been using the same bungee set since Nov. With a new unused bungee, we should be fine through the remainder of the flight. We could use some words from the ground whether Exp-2 will bring their own bungee sets so we know what to leave behind. We still consider the bungee we removed to be serviceable, but we are packing it up and will have it ready to send to the ground so engineers may inspect-we thought this might be of interest too. It is more time efficient to use one set of bungees for all 3 crew than to swap these individually for each exercise session.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 22 lines]

We discussed the IMAX scenes for 5A and subsequent filming. We are planning the shootings out the window and we would like to ask that a second exterior roll be left onboard, if possible. We think we will use it.

We are still having trouble with the state vector callouts on the earth obs files-sites today were as much as 10 minutes in error from our true position. We have verified that laptop times are accurate.

We were asked to provide more info on the "RPCM Jumper" cable that was used for the FPP activation last week. The nomenclature on the cable is :
"UOP POWER
RPCM PIGTAIL 120VDC"


PAO downlink today:


We would like to pass to the ground our thoughts on Challenger, and the 15 years which have passed--

We add a minute of salute onboard to the many which will be given today on Earth. That we are able to mark this in flight, in space-is a most fitting tribute to the memories of our fallen crewmates and friends.
It was said that this tragedy would bring a long period of renewed endeavor in space-that we would fly more safely and with greater success. This has been realized. Let us take pride in the many good missions which have flown since, and account this the continuing legacy of Challenger and her crew.
Today we are working and living in space--a new era, a new enterprise--the permanent presence of humans away from planet Earth. As a concept, it's not that exceptional. We have always been in the "frontier" business.
Infinite, boundless dimensions define "space". Our need to explore and to fulfill the human potential defines us. Space is austere, harsh, unforgiving--but as logical a place for us to be as any path that man ever walked. It is "high ground" for the human experience. Let the name "Challenger" give us pause to reflect on, and purpose to continue--our voyage of exploration and discovery.

TGIF. Sergei's first job of the day is the TEPC download. This took more than 12 hours the last time we did it-Sergei copies the data readout and moves TEPC to its new location on SM panel 338. It is convenient to the MEC computer there. Sergei hooks up the RS 232 and starts the download the first time without any difficulty.

Yuri and Shep are working on some more data base items. We have incorporated all the uplinked delta files sent as of Thursday night.

It's food ops morning and we set up to sort the leftover food from the containers in the pantry. We pull out all the tomatoes and eggplant and vanilla breakfast drinks and make sure these go in the Progress. Containers are broken down and stowed for 5A return or stacked on the FGB deck. It is quite a pile of empty boxes now. New containers are pulled from storage in the FGB and we put these in the pantry.

We get the XL-1 camcorder going to start scenes for the educational video. We get the food transfer ops on tape. Lots of good movement of containers flying around station-should be interesting.

Sergei starts the software load for the Regul packet comm.. He is scheduled for an hour here, but it ends up taking most of the day to get done.

1230 We have an OCA lik up with the 2nd. Expediton crew. Comm quality is good-better than any previous crew briefing we have had.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 24 lines]

We get a good start on the taping for the educational "Meet Me at the Station" video. Lighting in the Node is just too dark and we will probably reshoot a few scenes with some more illumination. But we got about 8 useable scenes done today on the script. Thanks to the planners for timelining this.

Last job of the day is the CSA-CP download, and this goes per plan. In all, we had a full day, and we're definitely looking forward to a slow weekend.

We eat dinner and watch "GI Jane". Lots of SEAL questions, and Shep explains why this is not exactly like the real SEAL training.

MACE and IMS day. Yuri has the first job of the day, checking CO2 levels with the Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Kit. We spent considerable time yesterday trying to find it. We had rearranged its loc er stowage last week. The CDMK was in the right location, but had a lot of bags on top of it and was difficult to locate. We have written large bar code numbering on each side of the bag, and this is a help particularly in the FGB. Yuri changes out batteries and starts the monitor. Percentages agree pretty well with the readings from the onboard gas analyzers.

Sergei is testing out the Blood pressure/ECG kit. Shep and Sergei are reading the instructions. It takes a while to figure out that you have to hold the electrodes or the BP cuff won't inflate. The procedure is kind of unclear on this, but at least everything works.

Shep starts the MACE troubleshooting in the Node. We step through the procedure and finally get the MACE to operate after a PC card is swapped out in the secondary drive. The protocol we tested with, 11001, looks OK. The first protocol on the priority list is run, but it does not look as though MACE is doing anything. We call this down to the ground and Houston says this is expected. We only had time to run one more protocol and temp stowed the experiment so Yuri could pump some iron with the IRED.

Yuri, Sergei and Shep are working with the IMS for several hours in the afternoon. The SSC's are running normally-no significant slowdowns like we saw two days ago. Shep is stepping through OCA 1136 for answers to all the ground's questions.
We have a tagup on OCA late in the afternoon with IMS folks. This is very helpful, and we are able to clear up how some unique problems were generated by the bar code reader. We still have an inordinate number of things onboard whose bar codes are not logged into the database. Now that we are trying to run the system with these codes as the primary identifier, it takes a lot of time when we run into items that have bar codes and the database can't find them. We discuss this with the ground and agree that a top ground priority is to input this data, starting with computer equipment, and things we will need to use when 5A is in town.

Sergei and Yuri are swapping out electrical connections on the ARCU boxes per radiogram. We are going to test out the other ARCU channels.

1855. We are talking to Moscow and a group of schoolkids in TsUP. They are the winners of a nationwide contest on the space program, and are visiting TsUP. We send TV down and answer questions about the flight.

We eat some dinner and watch the last of "Used Cars" (we are definitely down to the movies you can't even find at Blockbuster).

Many thanks today to the OSO's for the heads-up on the wrenches-we did not know we had metric crow's feet onboard. We will have to try them out soon.

0610 We are up early. OCA is hung up in the middle of a file transfer. Mail and the execute package didn't make it. We reboot the OCA machine and wait to talk to Moscow. Daily package gets uplinked, and we don't have any big questions. We ask to keep the scopemeters in their present configurations. We will use the Russian meter with the rechargeable batteries as prime so we can conserve the alkaline "C" cells for backup power.
The ops summary details the tentative schedule for 5A and beyond-we are concerned because we are running out of good movies.

Sergei and Yuri start the day with the audiogram test on the medical computer, and then take some more acoustic measurements with the Russian sound level meter. We are kind of wondering when the ground's going to say they have enough data.

Shep put the new cables on IRED. The old set has moderate wear on the outside sheath of one of the cables, but otherwise looks very serviceable. The forward canister has occasionally been making "scraping" sounds. On inspection, the bottom cover has a light groove where it has been making contact with some part of the cable's metal hardware. Put the new cables in both canisters and reassembled.

1305 We have a PAO session with 3 media contacts on OCA. The voice quality to us is acceptable, but occasionally hard to understand. AP interviewer has some voice clipping as well. Apparently our audio down is good.


After lunch, Yuri and Shep start the calibration procedure for the IRED. At about the "8" load level, the forward canister starts scraping again. Yuri and Shep take the canister apart twice trying to improve the position of the cable hardware for adequate mechanical clearance. The cover for the forward canister is reinstalled and we still get some rubbing-it's intermittent and the best we can do for now.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 5 lines]

We all get workouts in on the TVIS and IRED. All the IRED hardware looks OK during visual inspection. The frayed harness cord serving is redone with the sail palm and needle. We realign the top plates on the canisters which were binding the squat bars. It was another strange tool day. We used the large pliers several times, and the impact driver was the only way we could have taken apart the IRED can 3 times in the day.
We have noted that the power tool battery charger will not charge the NiMH batteries when they are first inserted. They have to sit and then be re-inserted before the charger will work.

At the end of the day we checked the CMG status. Numbers in the data section below.

We are still having unusual email problems. After a late afternoon mail sync, we all had "outbox" mail which had not been taken, and nothing new put in the "inbox", so we think some part of the ground sync and upload to us was incomplete. Our mail problems have definitely been more frequent in the past 3 days, particularly for Sergei. He is pretty sure mail has been mislaid and he needs a way to account for what has been sent to him in the last 2 weeks

We eat dinner and watch the first part of "Used Cars".

We are going to have a full day of IMS ops. We have been waiting for this for the 2 weeks since the last "international IMS day". Shep starts out in the Node and Sergei and Yuri are working in the SM. The file server is acting up. Transactions between the client laptops and the server have much more delay than we have seen previously. Yuri had similar delays last weekend, but we have not worked intensively with the IMS since then. Today we are all inputting transactions and the system seems like it just can't keep up. Calls for data on individual objects has been taking 3-5 seconds. Today it seems like even the routine data from the server has significant delay-sometimes taking up to 4 minutes to complete. "History" pages are particularly slow in downloading. After a while, Sergei reboots the file server, but this does not improve the situation.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 20 lines]

We manage to get some more inventory work done during the breaks in the emergency drill. We are still setting up bar codes and checking locations in the Node against the database. We are definitely making progress although every bag is a small adventure. We still want to go around and identify all the deployed equipment onboard and make sure the IMS has it logged in the correct location, but we have only scratched the surface on that job.

Sergei is still having difficulties with his email. After the mail sync, he still has "outgoing" mail left instead of everything in the "sent" folder. We talk to Houston about this, as this has occurred a few times now with Sergei's files.

Many thanks to the OSO's and the others who made the "scopemeter" manual available. This will be very useful to us. We are already thinking that the diode test capability might be of interest if we are going to do something similar to the recent troubleshooting on Russian power equipment.

We have dinner and watch the first part of "The Big Lebowski".

0828 First comm. with Moscow today. Might be a record for a workday. First job this a.m. is some more troubleshooting with the MACE experiment. The equipment is set up as before-MACE has been stowed at the ready, so it is just a matter of rigging the tethers in the Node and powering things up. Stepping through the diagnostic procedure does not go as planned. On the first step, loading protocol 11001, we get the exact same indications as before-"download complete" followed shortly by "error-missing axis". Ground notes to "bypass" this do not work. We can not get the control software to do anything else. "Enter" key just puts us back into the top of a loop with MACE asking for a new protocol. We relay this word to Houston and standby.


Sergei and Yuri are opening panels on the veloergometer so they can troubleshoot. We are having trouble getting all the fasteners off. This turns into an all hands evolution. Sergei remarks that several of them are really "anti-theft" devices-little cups over the screw heads filled with some type of goo. Two screws won't come off. We get the impact tool out and it takes one off. We have to cut the other one off. Circuit "tray" inside looks more complex than you would expect-about 10 chips and 2-3 boards. Sergei pulls off a cable lead on the forward part of the tray and a clump of fine wires

Shep in the Node finishing up the last part of the JASON experiment. Documentation says to shoot 14 days of photos, so we do so and the last set are in the OCA-down folder tonight. JASON experiment and gear all stowed in the Node.

We tried to conduct one of the weekly PMC's on the OCA today. OCA quality has been very good in the last part of the week, and was OK this a.m. during a call with CAPCOM. At 1525, we were unable to get a two-way voice link with the Flight Doc. We think this has to be some type of configuration issue on the ground-we are not changing anything onboard that we know of.

1650 Yuri gets good coverage of the Parana River basin, so we can scratch that one off the Earth Obs list. Our site times are still 5 minutes behind our actual ground track-and we're hoping the ground team can take this lag out of future lists sent up.

Shep and Sergei works on resetting the gains on the audio dosimeters. We are using the wardroom table for "IFM central". Having a flat place where you can spread everything out and get right on top of it is most useful-much better than trying to do this on a panel somewhere. One unit took the new settings and appears functional. The second unit displayed the "UFL" indication (bad) when switched into "slm" mode. We talk to Houston on this and we change batteries and try it again. The second unit has the same result.

We are continuing to see some strange things on our email-particularly the sizes of files. We are trying to keep minimum messages in our inbox and outboxes, and we still see large ".ost" files moving to the ground-2.5 Mb each. We don't understand why these are so large.

We all got some gym time, ate dinner and watched "Carlito's Way" with Russian subtitles. You have to watch some cops and robbers to see how much Russian there is that they never taught you in class.

Working on IMS today. It is amazingly slow going trying to fix the database. And it is very hard just to work on one thing at a time. It's a network of incorrect things that are all intersecting.

During the OCA fix yesterday, the "Russian" scopemeter was hooked up to the US power supply, but the batteries did not take a charge after several hours. We're not sure the charger circuit is working properly, but we plan on looking in to this soon. We have a limited supply of "C" batteries as backups, but it would be better not to have to rely on these.

Yuri is going through all the gear deployed now in the Service Module and checking whether it is correctly reflected in the database. Almost everything is stuff that we moved very early on in the mission and we did not generally have time to work the inventory. We have to stop now and recount what we did, when, and where to figure it all out.

1420 Ham radio contact with Sherman Elementary in upstate NY. The comm. pass goes very well. Had the questions in advance and this helps the pass proceed very rapidly. We are continually surprised by the quality of the questions coming from young audiences. We field approx 20 questions in an 8 minute period.

We had a good planning conference with Houston and Moscow. We talked about scheduling for next week, and general issues for the rest of the mission. We are very interested to see any of the present options being discussed with the 5A delay, and also whatever "strawman" plan is in work for the remainder of the flight. OCA comm. quality is the best we have had. If it holds, we are ready to try the mid term debrief when there is time next week.

We tag up with the SSC team on OCA, and discuss the 5A network transition. One of the key items will be adequate hardware for network wiring. We do a quick inventory after the videocon and we have (roughly):

2 X 25 feet coax
4 X 3 feet coax
a few "T" connectors

We would like to ask that 5A show up with enough gear so that we end up with at least the following spares, which will be above the 5A outfitting requirements:

3 spare hard drives-3 GB or bigger
3 spare network dongles and cards-we have no working spares left
3 spare PC card extenders-we are finding that every laptop needs these
more spare coax-at least--
2 X 25 feet
4 X 10 feet or 4X 6 feet
6 X 3 feet
10 each of the T, Coupler, and Terminator connectors


Missed a whole comm. pass over White Sands . We need to get the timex watches working so we don't overlook these calls.

We took the 13th day of JASON photos and put them in the usual OCA-down folder. We think we are supposed to have one more day of photography on this-so we are leaving everything set up.

Sergei was on the TVIS, and this seemed like a good time to shoot photos of the SLD cable that we thought had some wear to it. 3 photos taken and sent down in the Checs folder tonight. Photos 240 and 250 are left cable, 260 is right. We thought there was a small flaw in the sheath on the left cable but it turns out that it is some kind of paint or marking. There is nothing wrong with the cable. We looked at the right cable and it has a smaller but similar mark, and is otherwise normal.

We watched the last ½ of "As Good As It Gets" and called it a day.

Hematocrit day. We get to draw a small amount of blood and fill up the little tubes. The small centrifuge rig is kind of neat.

"World Map" is back on the equator again. We talk to Houston about it. We are somewhat baffled, as the tabular data for the state vector says we should be in a 51 degree orbit.

Took the CMG data with SSC 3 in the Node. The DAT/PASS software worked fine. Data below.

We are talking over breakfast about the work that we will have in front of us between lab arrival and before we depart on 5A.1. This period will include moving the Soyuz and docking, unloading, and undocking the next Progress. It looks like we will be very busy. Sergei says the last part of the flight is always busy.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 16 lines]

Checked the TVIS box temps during exercise today-Electric box temp 95.6
Motor temp-96.0.

Yuri changes out the conservant container for ???. We have questions for ??? about hooking up the hoses, and Yuri talks to the ground for 2 passes on this.

First thing after lunch, we have a press conference on OCA. The audio for the onboard system is back in business. Houston says the voice quality is good, and we do three interviews with reporters .

We have asked ??? earlier about taking off connectors and cables from the KURS radar installation in Progress. These might come in handy for troubleshooting other equipment later. We get the go to take a few of these out. Sergei and Yuri are working in the Progress to identify the right cables and take them off. We had asked for the RT-50 breakout box to be included in our IFM gear before flight, but this was not made available. We just don't like throwing things away that we might need later.


Shep in the Node doing the JASON photography. The photos are coming out better with the lighting scheme we are using-also manual focus is much more consistent on the plastic pouches. Photo shooting and downloading is still taking 50-60 minutes depending on how things go.

Everyone used the IRED today. We did the weekly inspection. Cords and fittings look OK on the canisters. We have some minor fraying on one of the cords on the shoulder harness, but the fraying is just on the white serving thread which is on one of the thimbles-its not in the load path. We will grey tape this if necessary.
We have some scraping noise on the forward canister at loads above "8" and near maximum cord extension. We plan on taking this canister off and inspecting the cord and thimble-maybe tomorrow. We have had this noise once before when the internal thimble was out of position.

As 5A is now delayed, we would like to request the "timex" watch software if it is available on the ground-a file that can be uplinked to us. This will help us manage our day as we can load comm. passes into the watches.

We have the new form 24 onboard and are glad to see all the time tomorrow for IMS. We will use it.

Got the word that Atlantis is delayed several weeks. Lab delay is critical as we are running out of movies that we have not watched. We will have to start the shipboard routine where we turn the sound down and everyone mouths the words, cause we know them so well. We will, however, have more time to get ready for all the lab activation and installation jobs, and we might even have the IMS sorted out by the time Atlantis docks.

We crank up the body mass measuring rig to get the numbers for each crew. Getting this set up is sort of an art-Yuri has got it down, however, and once it is running right, this takes about 2 minutes to do.

First systems thing today is to put ??? in regeneration mode.

Shep and Yuri were scheduled to unload PMA 3, but this has been cancelled as a result of the 5A changes. Shep and Yuri given the a.m. to work inventory. Yuri starts in on the database with a large pile of notes.

We decide today would be a good time to fix the OCA headset cable, as the appearance of a replacement unit has just moved right a few weeks. Shep and Sergei pull out the scopemeter and start checking the continuity on the connector pins. The diagram in the OCA message is a big help.

We find fairly quickly that the "sleeve" wire does not connect between both ends of the cable on the leg to the microphone jack. We cut the wiring and do a check again, and isolate the problem to the end with the 1/8" plug, which fortunately, is right where we made the cut. Tried to take the plug apart, but this was all glued together. We pulled the wiring off a set of Sony CD speakers to get another jack that would fit the back of the laptop. We stripped and spliced the wire, which was very fine-24, maybe 26 gauge. We don't want to use our few butt splices for this, and the wires are too fine anyway, so we pull out the soldering iron to see how that works.

First problem is that we can't plug the iron in. Plugs are Mir-style, and apparently the sockets in the SM are different (more leads). So we do another IFM to hook the iron up. Then the little soldering tube on the end won't fit the iron-it's the wrong size. So out comes the Contingency Clamp Kit and we safety wire the tube to the end of the iron. It works. We tin the leads, put some tubing on them and insulate with electric tape. ( The Russian side did provide this, and it does work.) We get the cable hooked up, and do a mike check. We have an OCA hookup with the Chief Astronaut and the system is working. That's the good news. Bad news is that we now have another failure-looks like the earphone cable is bad-maybe the same type of wire-connector failure. .Today's IFM took us maybe 3 ½ hours. But the external laptop speakers are working and we have the OCA comm. link back.

In all, we have recently experienced-a scopemeter we can't recharge because we can't plug it in, a soldering iron which has the wrong size tips, which we can't plug in either, a vise we can't use because it's still on the ground, and "rivnuts" we can't use because we don't have the right drill bits. Not to mention a workbench that's still on the ground somewhere too. We are enjoying finding all these "surprises" particularly before we would need these tools to do something critical. It would be nice, however, just to be able to pull these things out and start using them. We would like to encourage a better process to integrate and check this gear before we see it.

We also need to expand the "pin kit" to include Russian-size pins and sockets, and more wire splicing gear. The kit is very useful as is, but it is stocked for a short Shuttle flight, and we need higher quantities of consumables like butt splice connectors. (We only have 4 each of 2 sizes--one IFM could use them all and then some). We also need wire and connectors to make up our own cables as required-we can not rely on Shuttle or Progress to bring us cables from the ground on short notice.

0648 First comm. with Moscow, and Houston wants to pass us some word. Something is always up when Houston needs to talk this early. We get some words on the PMA 2 ingress and a change to the mid-term debrief plan for OCA today.

First work of the day has Shep and Sergei scheduled to start putting IMAX gear together, but we decide to put this off until later. We work on pulling the IRED platform loose from the Node overhead and getting access to the Z-1 standoff so that we can extract the SAFER rigs. We move the IRED baseplate out and pull the SAFER CTB down. We open the PMA 3 hatch and swap the SAFERS for a 3.0 CTB of Orlan spares. We are trying to avoid having to pull the IRED again this expedition, unless of course, we need the Orlan spares. Job takes just over 2 hours.

We also open up panel S3 in the Node, and take out the HEPA filter bag. We undo 5 straps that could pull large pickups, and a bag which could hold about 2 real unhappy bobcats. All for 4 filters. We see what look to be spare IMV valves also tucked away in this location, and we are wondering if these will be needed any time soon as part of the upcoming reconfigurations.

Shep read the WMK water samples, all looked ok. Data partially entered into the MEC, but the data page went into a loop 2 or 3 times when the "date" field was entered incorrectly. If the format was not what the application wanted, it put you into a loop where the only apparent way out was to close the program. Gave up on this after a while and decided to send the data down on mail. See data field below.

Server was backed up per schedule. No problems, although we are receiving messages when we log into the server that the "register" is full. Occasionally, the clients on the net are running slowly, especially with IMS pages. Responses for IMS inquiries today on Yuri's SSC1 were slow enough to be unusable.

Yuri got some good cargo loading done in the Progress, with Shep and Sergei passing things to be stuffed in there. All of the heavy items are stowed. We still have a lot of light trash-paper, clothes, foam, etc. to put in.

Kurs radar set is packed and bagged (one 3.0 CTB and one 1.0 CTB) and in the Node looking for a ride home. We understand that 5A.1 will probably take this.

1430 We get the "go" to do PMA 2 ingress. We open the depress display so we can watch for any anomaly. (We also want to see the graphing capability work). Opening the MPEV starts a substantial flow. Station drops to 750 and then 745 mm, about what was predicted. We open the hatch and PMA 2 is very warm inside. CPA's are warm as well. Everything inside is significantly warmer than the rest of station, and the Node is rather hot right now. We go right at the duct clamps and pull the duct out so the latch test can begin. The whole interference with the latch arm looks to be a design problem. There really isn't any good way to rig the duct without having it very close to the latch arc. The rubber duct section is stowed in the Node. Houston cycles the latch, and it looks normal. We close the PMA 2 hatch. (Had 4 hatches open in the Node today-we think that will be a record for a while.)

Yuri and Sergei are setting up to change a thermal system pump package on FGB as the PMA ingress is starting. ??? wants the old pump package put in Progress. Yuri's "leatherman" gets a workout on the pump fittings.

After the PMA ingress, we put things back together in the Node and started to rig the CBCS camera system for a check. We could not find one of the video cables for about a half hour until Sergei remembered that we had used it for the OCA hookup for TV from Progress. CBCS powered up and looks sOK on the laptop display.

In between the action in the Node today, we got the JASON experiment photos shot and sent down. Now that we know better how to do this, it is going more quickly-50 minutes or so.

We each got a run in and some time in the "weight room". Ate dinner and watched the first disk of "Dr. Strangelove."

0650 Got the news in the Ops summary and during the comm. pass that we are going to delay the PMA 2 entry. Ground to send some commanding starting about 0830 and we are to observe latch action through the hatch window. We are 100% sure the duct is going to be in the way-and it looks well strapped down. We have breakfast and try some more OCA troubleshooting.

We rig the XL-1 video camera for audio feed to the OCA laptop per the ops note. First OCA pass with Houston we give it a try, and it is working. Apparently the audio quality is good-maybe better than the VLHS headset mike we were using. Did not get a chance today to electrically check the suspect cable. We will look at this over the weekend.

0830 Sergei at the Node forward hatch, observing and trying to get some video of the latch. Shep on comm. with Houston. We see latch arm #2 retract out of sight (aft) and then extend, touch the duct, and stop-exactly the same position as before, with contact right on the duct. The other latches are cycled later and all look normal. We could not get a good view with the video camera-and we are standing by for more ingress words.

Yuri and Sergei start installing ???? 3, which is down in the "bilge" alongside the velo ergometer. Impact driver is in action. (We use this thing every day).

Missed another Earth Obs site this a.m. at 10:13. Our ground track was at least 10 minutes ahead of this callout on our form 24.

Had a good discussion also on OCA with Marsha Ivins about the 5A gear transfer, and what order the shuttle crew needs things from us. We are feeling like we are in good hands here.

The crew got a run in and a session in the "sport hall". TVIS and IRED both working normally.

SHIP'S LOG 11 JAN

0615 Vampire day. The "reflotron" is out on the Service Module deck. We each take turns with the little finger jabber and squeeze out blood samples for the analyzer. Sergei gets to run all of the chem. strips through the machine, which is going to take all morning. We hit the coffee locker after the blood work, although the locker is getting somewhat bare. Eagerly anticipating an "UNREP" from the 5A crew.

Today is also CKB-2 thermal insulation day. Apparently ??? is planning on running the thermal loop somewhat colder in the future, so although the airconditioning unit is not condensing on its exterior now, it may start doing so soon when it gets better heat exchange. Yuri's working making a thermal blanket for the compressor. Shep helps with the design and layout work. We have a little marlinspike seamanship session with the sail palms and needles. We start stitching up a blanket from cargo bag material. CTB serial 2992-1J won't be making the trip home, having given 100% for the program today. Sergei and Yuri do the final fitting, and cover the blanket with metal foil tape. We take a few pictures for the OCA-down\Dcs\Skv2 folder tonight. Yuri says he's ready for a day job as sailmaker.
This was a very good project for us, as it was one of those unstructured things that we could all contribute to. We learned a lot.

Shep does the CMG data take in the Node with the laptop. All interactions looked normal. Data recorded below.

Shep worked the OCA comm. problem for the bulk of the morning and into the afternoon. Tried all the steps that were on the troubleshooting message and a few that weren't. Software was reloaded, expansion chassis swapped, spare headset tested, etc. Audio was still bad. We were trying to find a spare microphone which could be hooked up to the OCA which would localize the comm. problem. We don't have any other microphone onboard which has a compatible jack or connector, so we try hooking up a set of earphones to the mic jack. Talking into the speakers seems to drive the test lights on the audio input display. We try a test a bit later with Houston, and though we are broadcasting somewhat "backwards" through the gear, it works. We think it's "causality"-- we also think the VLHS/Video Teleconf. cable is bad. (SED 16102919-301)

We got on the TVIS today and tried 2 sets of bungees (4 total) on the SLD's. This worked well, TVIS was fine, and we were able to load the treadmill above 70kgs. Although Sergei does not need to do this because of his height, the elongation of the single bungees on his settings is substantial. Running with more bungees looks a lot more serviceable.

This evening, Sergei and Shep rig some alternative lighting and change the compensation on the DCS 460 camera. We have had lots of reflection problems in photographing the seed growth experiment through clear plastic wrappers. We finally have some JASON photos that we're happy with, and these are in tonight's OCA-down folder

Strange tools used on ALPHA today-

sail palm and needle (for the airconditioner blanket)
diamond hone (smoothed up galling on the heel block pins for IRED.)

All in all, we had a busy day, trying to anticipate the ground's next call on troubleshooting. We are thoroughly enjoying the "Mr. Wizard" lessons.

600 Up early this a.m.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 6 lines]

Started the water sampling. 2 procedures, 16 pages, changes via OCA (2 sets) and a CAPCOM call with more info. Basically take the 3 water outlets onboard, clean them, run some flush water, and put water in 5 sample bags. Just understanding all the instructions requires 40 minutes. We wish there was a way to make this simpler- recommend going to a more graphic presentation of how to set up the equipment. Water samples were transferred to the microbial devices and are now incubating in the Node.

Sergei and Yuri are checking a cable run for a satellite comm. system to be installed in the SM sometime TBD.

We finish putting insulation on the suction line for the air conditioner, CKB-2. This line was making about 50cc's of condensate water every day, and we were tiring of having to mop it up. We used foam insulation cut out of a CTB divider (about 3/8"), wrapped on the piping. Although a bit thick for the task, the foam does a good job of keeping the line cold and we now have only a few small drops on a control valve which is bare metal.

Shep working some IMS issues with the WMK and WSA water kits. The WSA lives inside a single CTB, and is itself a full bag of subpacks. The CTB and the WSA kit each have barcodes that are different, but the database only reflects the WSA's barcode, and does not "show" that it is really a kit inside a 1.0 CTB. Spent about 20 minutes cleaning that data up, emptied the CTB for return, and put the WSA kit back in its stowage location.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 12 lines]

After lunch, Shep was getting a late start on the CSA-CP gas analyzer, when CAPCOM calls. Houston has a priority request to take down the berthing camera and look through the Node forward hatch at one of the latches for the forward CBM. Apparently the latch did not travel its full run when tested. We move a bunch of bags off of the Node D1 area and remove the camera. We can see latches 1 and 2 in different positions, and the #2 latch is right up against some red rubber ductwork. We tell ground what we are looking at and have some brief discussion about going in PMA 2 to fix. Looking at this some more in the early evening, we think the best short term solution will be to unfasten and remove the section of duct that is in the way.
CSA-CP prime and backup units recalibrated, but did not have time to do the MEC data downloads.

Everyone gets a turn in on the TVIS. We are learning more and more. Sergei notes that the eyes for the cables on the Subject Load Devices are pulled right down to the pulley wheels when Shep is on the treadmill. It turns out that if you set the load at anything above about 65-70 kg, the cables get pulled all the way to mechanical contact with the pulley, and load to the user will not increase. We thought we had been using the TVIS at considerably higher forces, but apparently this is not the case. We all have our harnesses "two-blocked" (pulled all the way up) and the adjustment still is not right. We think the best short term solution is to marry 2 sets of bungees on each side to increase the stiffness of the restraints.
Did the temperature checks on TVIS-Electrical box 93 deg, motor temp 88.6.

We hear late in the day that Moscow plans on bringing the Kurs radar set home on Shuttle flight 5A.1. More gear in the attic.

SHIP'S LOG 09 JAN

Yuri and Sergei start the morning with the Soyuz data file and a bunch of self-study on deorbit procedures. We have 2 comm passes to discuss with our Soyuz instructor.

Shep starts the day with Audio Dosimeter troubleshooting to prepare for spot checks and hearing assessments later in the day. Got a bit tripped up at the outset, as it was not clear that the OCA message was a new procedure. Hunted around the Med Ops Book for the "old" procedure, but couldn't find one. There is definitely more of a tendency on a computer to read things one screen at a time, Details which would have explained this were on the following page. This is just something we will have to be conscious of as we are using procedures (and writing them). Additionally, a way to highlight that this is a new procedure would be most helpful.
Both audio dosimeters' batteries checked out "OK" but both read "UFL" in the SLM mode, which we interpreted as no-go. Talked to Houston and relayed that we think the dosimeters are failed.

Shep wrote down the TEPC numbers and moved the TEPC to SM panel 110, where it was initially located in Nov. TEPC running normally. Data is recorded in the section below.

Shep and Sergei spend about 1 ½ hours in the Node doing the MACE troubleshooting. The entire MACE connector configuration is photographed and files sent to the ground. We take the MACE unit apart piece by piece and check connectors, and reassemble. Several times we did the MACE activation procedure thinking we might have changed something, and we still have the "missing gimbal" signals problem. We are stuck in step 1 of the recovery plan and we wait to talk to Houston.

Sergei and Shep get on the TVIS in sequence. Did the weekly maintenance cable check during the workouts, but missed the temperature data. We will get that tomorrow. TVIS is functioning normally.

Shep took the hearing assessment with the MEC and the EarQ software, even though the acoustic dosimeter was not working. Initially the test was not working, but found that the trouble was isolated to a "prophonics" set of searpieces. Swapped to the backup set and did the test, which should be logged in the MEC.

Houston comes back in the afternoon and recommends redoing the acoustic dosimeter troubleshooting with OCA message 922. We do this, and get the same results. We also check the Lav/Lequ mode. The readings on both dosimeters is 00.0 dB after several minutes. We discuss again with Houston and receive the recommendation to defer the acoustic survey and the rest of the assessment tests.

Late afternoon, we took another set of "Jason" photos on the plant growth experiment. We really appreciate the added time in the plan to do this. Even today, with lots of hands-on here, the photography and downloading took longer than scheduled, as we had to reshoot a few frames which looked good on camera but were not OK when we viewed the files.

We were unable to get any more troubleshooting in on the MACE. Standing by for a new schedule.

We have been using OSTPV onboard and it is definitely useful, but we are experiencing occasional slow to very slow performance. We are wondering if the server is at capacity handling all the client services now, particularly with world map, IMS, and OSTPV sometimes all running simultaneously.

Early evening--we are discussing the Russian gear that will be downloaded to 5A with Moscow. The large Kurs docking radar set which was removed from Progress does not seem to be on any of the planning "radar screens" to return on Shuttle. We need words on this ASAP if it is not going to be sent down.

We call it a day, get some chow, and watch the first part of "Catch 22".

Up at the usual zero-6-something. IMS-Day. Talking to Moscow and looking at the overnight mail and execute package. The browser is working well, and this is a much more convenient system for finding things than doing it on paper. Searches on the messages onboard folder could be better, but it is workable. A keyword search feature here would be most useful.

Trying to print out the OCA messages about the IMS details. Printer is still acting up and printing half pages. We have been feeding it strange paper, (green) and wonder if that has offended it. We try the reboot technique sent up from the ground, and that seems to help for a while. Then the printer goes back to its old ways. We would still like to know how to change permissions so that the client SSC's can cancel print jobs in the print queue-we are still blocked from doing this.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 13 lines]

Yuri and Sergei spend the entire day plowing through just some of the consumables onboard-towels, ???'s ???'s and all the salfetkies. We got through less than ½ of what we expected to accomplish today. We discuss this with specialists in Houston at the end of the workday, and we agree that we could use another IMS day soon, preferably before 5A. We briefly discuss how we are going to make sure that procedures incorporate the most recent gear moves, name changes, etc.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 4 lines]

We also talked about the bar code reader, and we now have figured out how to toggle the one stuck in RF mode. The BCR's however, have very limited battery life. Just sitting on the wall charged but unused, they can go dead in less than 1 day. We discuss whether this might be a battery conditioning problem.

End the day with some JASON photos of the plant growth experiment. Getting the shots to look right with the plastic foil pouches and their reflections has turned out to be harder than it might seem. We promise we will get better at this.

Our quote for the day (inspired by our IMS adventures):

SHIP'S LOG 06 JAN 01

Got up late (for us). First comm. pass 0830. Houston wants the server rebooted so we go do that. Pretty light schedule for the day. We all get caught up on email and the many questions sent our way we have not had time to answer. We are all probably at the keyboard 3-4 hours each today.

Looking out the window, our new YVV attitude is a change of pace. Our world map state vector seems to be lagging about 5 minutes behind our position, but the track looks about right.

We all get in a run on the TVIS-ops normal. We know we still owe some TVIS questionnaire info-we'll try to get to this.

After lunch-the ???-? "full" light comes on in the head. We pull out the full container and make ready a new one. We also notice on the cycle counter that we have just crossed the 1,000 "traps" mark with the ???. Yuri says this always the halfway point on a mission. We decide this should be a new Astronaut Office patch.

We do the photo documentation for the JASON seed growth experiment. JPEG images are located in the Oca-down\DCS\Jason folder. Had a lot of reflection off the plastic wrappers and the autofocus kept jumping around. We will try and improve this for subsequent shots. Shooting and downloading files is taking about 70 minutes total. Form 24 has 20 minutes scheduled on the plan. Just moving files off the PC card probably takes 30-40 minutes. We are happy to do this-just would like to see the plan give us more time here.

We asked about a battery tester on our last logistic request. We would like to know more about whether we can reliably use the scopemeter for checking batteries. We're not sure how to do this, as we think the battery has to be measured under load to indicate its charge. Plan B is to just stick the battery in the nearest flashlight and see how bright it is. Any more scopemeter words on this would be useful.

Finished the day with more email and watched "The Rock".

SHIP'S LOG 05 JAN

More Orlan work today. Yuri and Sergei are getting ready to finish the last parts of the suit checkouts. Bio instrumentation needs to be checked, as well as the "Corona" antenna units which are to be placed in the ???. Two suits moving around in the transfer "otsek" are pretty bulky, but not as tight as the pool simulations seemed in the hydrolab.

Shep gets started to take data from the CMG's using the DAT hard drive and SSC 3. The form 24 pointed us at the full and rather lengthy CMG activation and checkout. Ground quickly got on top of that one and made sure we were on the correct OCA message. Procedure to check data is much shorter and we are now very familiar with it. Data take was quick and the results listed below in data entry. FPP experiment restarted at the conclusion of the CMG work.

Yuri, Sergei finish up with Orlan checkouts. Orlans and spares, kits, and checkout gear restowed in PMA 3. No moisture inside, air temperature seemed 2-3 deg C warmer than Node.

The crew would like to thank the entire Thermal Control Group/Thor for bringing down the temperature in the Node-it is much more livable in there now.

Sergei shoots video of the insulation on the cover of illuminator 9. The outer layer of MLI-like insulation has some tears on it. Ground wants to see what this looks like.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 18 lines]

The crew did a 25 minute PAO event with Fox network and a Los Angeles radio station. The OCA comm. went well We were asked to give a traffic report on the San Diego freeway, but this was kind of hard as we were over the Indian Ocean at the time. We could use a little more heads up on whether video down will be part of the event. We were not sure about this today for the first news contact.

Shep and Sergei set up the JASON plant growth experiment in the Node. The plant samples which are to be light-exposed are now decorating the quarterdeck. We were checking the seed types in the hope one might be "palm tree". Digital photos were JPEG'd and will be sent down in new folder OCA down\DCS\Jason. We could use a few more PAO words on what is planned regarding interaction during the JASON expedition-we are ready to talk to some Argonauts.

Missed the 1630 GMT Earth Obs site. Ground was in darkness and we are still wondering if we are in sync with the Earth Obs group on state vectors. Sergei points out this may affect the analysis of archived shots if we are not logging the same vector information.


2034 We do a second ham radio school pass with Armstrong School in Hampton Va. It took us about ½ the pass to get hooked up, but we did get about 8 good questions from students. One question was about whether you can ingest food the same way in orbit, or whether it moves differently in your stomach. We said that it does feel different, but that you get used to it. (Over to the docs on the real answer, and send that student to med school).


Finished the 2nd disk of "2010". Something strange about watching a movie about a space expedition when you're actually on a space expedition.

0600 Right after getting up, noticed that the MEC finished its TEPC download at 0500 (this download was started 1600 the day before-and estimated at 4 hours.) Confirmed MEC had the data in the correct downlink file. Forgot that the network card was disconnected so that the TEPC could talk through the MEC 232 port without interruption. Ground passed word to us after lunch that MEC was not on the net and we reset the card. Hopefully TEPC data got to the ground. TEPC powered and back online in its previous location.

We did the time update on the SSC file server. When the server time was reset using the clock icon from the system tray, the "apply" button was used. (procedure did say use the "OK" button) This put the update program in some type of loop which we could not get out of. Had to shut down the server and restart. When the server came back up, correct time was resident. We don't know if this is a one-time anomaly or there is some problem here. Went ahead and broadcast the new time to the network.


Yuri and Sergei unload the Orlan suits and spare parts from PMA 3. We all spend about 2 hours in the Node between arranging suits and equipment and setting up the MACE gear. Orlans were moved to the ??? which freed up enough space in the Node for MACE to run. But the suit work in ??? also blocks access to the Service Module for much of the day. It would have also been an excellent training opportunity for Shep to review the suit maintenance steps, and electrical, cooling, and pressure checks that Yuri and Sergei were doing. We make a mental note that when we work on the suits, we should just not have a lot of other things on the schedule.

Yuri and Sergei do their periodic fitness assessment on TVIS. We think this would be much simpler to execute if we were given integer values for the treadmill speeds. We have to change these speeds by keyboard input, and doing this on the fly is awkward as it is. We don't know the Russian acronym for "KISS".

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 10 lines]

. We discuss logistics-apparently 50Kg. of office supplies for Exp-2 are coming up on the next Progress. We have a lot of office-type material onboard which should be available for subsequent expeditions. Apparently the big-picture plan is a bag-for bag swap. We have consolidated some items in one central location-printer paper, batteries, Ziploc bags as examples. We think some type of inventory is the way we should manage this long term vice doing bag swaps.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 16 lines]

Got the MPV files unzipped and updated on the server using the 4AODF CD-ROM. No problems with the procedure.

1900 Sergei and Yuri still working on the suits. One Orlan pressure checked, but the second suit still to go. A lot of the planning for the day's work has just been unrealistic. Plan had 10 minutes to pressure check the suits. Sergei and Yuri need about 30 minutes on each suit doing this, and this does not count a lot of setup time to get ready for this step Quick break for chow, and we talk to ??? about the schedule. We should have set aside 2 days to do this.
We joke with Glavni about the "super new" revision we have for tomorrow's form 24, but it has been a very full day for Yuri and Sergei (about 13 hours of work)-plus the second day in a row they do not get IRED time in their schedule.

Up at the usual "crack of dawn". We are orbiting where we get continuous light now, so "dawn" doesn't really apply to us. Kind of like being above the Arctic Circle with the Sun right on the horizon. Sergei and Yuri have ????? set ups this a.m. with lots of medical equipment out on the SM bulkhead. No coffee until the blood draws are done. Shep thought at first ????? meant "squid" in English, but was relieved to learn it's "octopus". We warm up and test the coffee pot.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 7 lines]

Shep checked the CO2 levels in Node, FGB, and SM. Data below in lines 1,2,3. All values consistent and look acceptable.

Did the TEPC data take and logging-this listed below as data line 4.

In between other jobs, Shep worked the Node and finished organizing the hardware for the MACE work on Thursday. MACE is going to be located in the P2 area inboard of the port hatch. Subsequent setup and stowage time between runs should be minimal.

Got word from the IRED engineers regarding the loose handle on the IRED canister. Popped the handle off and got some pliers on the right nut, and the handle is now back in its original position. IRED checks were normal. One small problem-the pin holding the collar and shackle together on the canister line can't be adequately checked, as this is covered with a serial number label. We figure the pin isn't going anywhere with the label on.

Did the TVIS monthly and the weekly maintenance checks. Did a time reset, was about 4 minutes off. Temps for electrics were 95.6 degrees, and for the motor 89.1 degrees. We will have to get to the answers for the TVIS questions tomorrow. The explanations are a bit lengthy, and just did not get them done today.

Sergei and Yuri finish the battery checks. We could probably have done this better using the scopemeter special function to check diodes, as that's what we think we were doing, but again, we need a little more info on the scopemeter's capabilities to be fully ready. ??? decides we have a bad ????.

Backed up the file server after lunch. Learned that when we pull the PC card now being used with the server for more memory, it loses the "sharing" property when it leaves and this has to be redone when it is reinserted. Backup was normal, and is going much faster now that we leave the server configured with the card extender. We just wish they were not so flimsy.

Next job for the scopemeter today is a check of a circuit for the fuel system compressor. Sergei and Yuri are reaching way back behind SM 338 to get to the connectors, and it's pretty much mission impossible. Out comes the impact driver, and we take off a bunch of ductwork above SM 245. This would have been a 1 hour job by hand and with power tools, its maybe 15 minutes. We are right on top of the required box. Scopemeter says the connectors are OK and ground thinks that we have a blown fuse in the line.

Shep has to wait a bit to get at the medical computer (MEC) as we are all trying to work in the same area. Ran through the setup procedure per OCA 573B and MEC comm. port is in the correct config. We think we did this port config about 4 weeks ago after some troubleshooting for the polar watch. Anyway, no changes were required, and hooked up the TEPC for a comm. check. At first, the TEPC and MEC did a handshake, and TEPC kept dropping off after 35 seconds. Finally got the download program to run, and TEPC has been downloading for 6+ hours and is still going. More words tomorrow.

Finished the day discussing IMS with specialists in Houston. We think we can help the process by quickly reviewing the intended changes for the data base that are generated on the ground. This will help to preclude some of the previous disconnects we have seen. We don't intend that this become SOP, only that we need to do this in the short term to get the data somewhat stable and reliable. We talk some other issues regarding inputs and bar coding. We are definitely making progress, and we still feel that the IMS is the way to go-we just have to stay on it.

Finished the day with the first disk of "2010". We note that the movie opens with a recounting of "Ship's Log" from the previous mission (2001).

We're up at the usual 0630 for first comm. with Moscow at 0640. We do the lower leg measurements and the body mass calculations right after comm. We have been chowing down pretty well, and the mass numbers reflect that. Everybody is very close to what was recorded preflight.

Yuri and Sergei are unloading food containers from the stowage pantry in the SM. We are eating virtually all the Russian chow, and somewhat less US stuff-maybe 75%. We spend about 30 minutes pulling out the uneaten tomatoes and eggplant, vanilla breakfast drinks, crackers, condiment packages, and dozens of drinking water containers, and bagging them. The food boxes get stacked in the passageway of the FGB and new containers are stowed in the pantry. The empty boxes will be filled with small wet trash bags and put in Progress soon.

By 1800, the Node is organized, database is correct for things we worked with today in the Node, and we have lots of room to do MACE experiments. MACE is now located on NOD1 D1. Unpacked some of the hardware and started assembly but decided the logistics work had to get done first. Knocked off at 1820 for some PT.

For the interest of the engineers, we took out the scopemeter and made some temperature readings. Bulk air temp in the Node today (1600) was 88 deg F. It feels just like Houston.
Temp directly on the skin of the PMA, at the cargo net, approx 16" up from APAS was 95.2 deg F.

Yuri and Sergei, between several filter change outs in SM, worked the database all day as well. Sergei and Shep consulted several times during the day reviewing gear that had been transferred from 4A. We are definitely struggling with IMS, logistics and the database, but all very determined to rope this thing to the ground and make it work. Late in the day we ask Houston for a time out tomorrow so we can discuss on OCA how we are going to better control the data in and out of the database-this is key.

Watched the last ½ of "2001" and called it a day.

FOR MEDIA RELEASE-ASAP


In longstanding naval tradition, the first entry in a ship's log for the New Year is always recorded in prose. We would like to share with all the entry being made in the log tonight as "Alpha" salutes the New Year-


SHIP'S LOG 001 01-JAN-2001

We sail onboard space station "Alpha"
Orbiting high above Earth, still in night
Traveling our destined journey
beyond realm of sea voyage or flight

A first New Year is upon us
Eight strikes on the bell now as one
The globe spins below on its motion
Counting the last thousand years done.

15 midnights to this night in orbit
A clockwork not of earthly pace
Our day with different meaning now
In this, a new age and place

We move with a speed and time
Past that which human hands can tell
Computers programmed-like boxes
Where only thoughts' shadows dwell

"Central post" our ship's bridge aboard
Screens dancing shapes in pale glow
We guide her course by electronic pulse
In figures no compass could show

Our panels set as sails to the Sun
With wake not ever seen but there
Only gyros feel the silent tugs
Wisps, swirls of such ocean rare

On this ship's deck sits no helm now
Rudder, sheet, and rig long since gone
But here still-- a pull to go places
Beyond lines where sky meets the dawn

Though star trackers mark Altair and Vega
Same as mariners eyed long ago
We are still as wayfinders of knowledge
Seeking new things that mankind shall know.

We commend to crews that will follow
Merit of the good ship we sail
Let Sun shine strong on Alpha's wings
A symbol, and bright star we long hail

SHIP'S LOG 11 MAR

Up at midnight. We're still trying to figure out what day it is. Docking yesterday went well, even with the station's configuration delays. Got some IMAX shots in during approach. Comm could have been better--we are still learning things about the system and how best to configure it based on what we are doing. A few of the areas we need work on are the setups for VHF comm. to Shuttle from the Lab, and the duration we can operate with the transmitters for lines 1 and 2 turned on in the SM.

Cargo transfer was going well yesterday, until we hit a snag finding EVA connectors to pass to the shuttle EVA'ers. We knew where all the bags we received from 5A were, but we couldn't identify how these connectors were "contained". The IMS data on these items did not give any detail except "crewlock bag". We asked the ground for help, and got enough information to start narrowing down which bag we were looking for. We finally located the special EVA bag (unmarked) with the connectors inside.

Shep starts the lab IMV valve installation, with Yuri and Sergei helping with IMS searches and chasing parts and tools. We look for, but can't find the IMV valves, which are not in the right bag. The label on the bag says "IMV valves" but they're not in there. (Besides the labeling problems, we are still receiving bags which are not properly id'd in the database-no bar code or bag description.)
Access to the port and starboard NPRV's is hampered by 2 large panels that won't come off. We remove pieces of seat track, and that helps somewhat, but the port panel (P1-01) is still mechanically hung up. In order to get more clearance, we query the ground and ask to detach the portside hatch track. We get the OK, and can't get the ground strap coupling to "uncouple". So we take out the TORK fastener which is holding the end of the strap to the hatch track frame. After freeing up the hatch track, we can see a bit behind the panel, and one of the Dzus fasteners is hung up in its sleeve. It is unhooked from its wire bail, but the small circular clip which keeps it captive is jamming in the panel hole. So we go for the hammer and drive it out. (not everybody gets to hammer on $1.4B of hardware). This has happened now on 3 of the lab Dzus fittings, and a long term solution for this should definitely be pursued.

Sergei's got the IMAX ready for our last 30 seconds of exterior film. We're trying to get a handle on the best time to be ready for Jim and Susan's walk.

We finally make some headway with the IMV valves-but the ductwork does not agree with what is illustrated in the assembly ops book. More comm. with Houston about part numbers. It seems we have a drawing out of config and the correct parts are onboard. The next task is to seat the IMV manual handles-but they are real tool challenges. Tightening the allen screws is physically "not possible" with the tools called out in the procedure, due to interference with the valve body. We snag a 5/16" ball-tip hex driver we got from Atlantis's toolbag and that's the only way the IMV valves went "in" today. We button up the surviving fasteners and clean up the forward lab endcone. Total time for the procedure-7 hours. Scheduled-2. (Thank you sir, may we please have another?)

Sergei gets an IMAX "shot of opportunity", with Jim motoring past the lab window on the end of the arm. Should be an outstanding segment.

630 Up and trying to get ready for the docking test.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 27 lines]

Sergei and Yuri are hooking up some ???? telemetry, trying to verify that the instrumentation on the velo-ergometer is good. The IFM yesterday on the velo worked-it's now back on line.

Sergei is also inputting new parameters for Plasma Crystal. The experiment is going great from our end. We are definitely seeing some unexpected results and the science team in Moscow is really excited. We are very happy that some serious science is going down to the ground. Sergei cranks up the experiment for about a 2 hour session in the morning.

Shep is in the lab putting up the ZSR's. Now we have some time to read the directions, and of course, the 2 we put up right away when 5A was in town were not quite right. (Marsha was not around to supervise.) So we have to wrestle with all the loose gear in the P1 bay and fix the "shield" in P2 ZSR. Ground checks with the ZSR control officer and we're not supposed to put up Overhead 3 in the lab-special request from Exp. 2. We're wondering if they did manage to manifest the sauna.

Sergei gets some exercise on TVIS. The treadmill is still hanging in there. We do the weekly checks-no changes to the hardware except slight chafing on a few of the bungee sheaths rigged as stabilizers. Nothing serious. Electric box temp is 87.6 and motor temp is 89.5.

??? gives us the word that they're changing the form 24 for tomorrow. It seems the second airconditioning unit-??? 2 has shut itself down. Low oil pressure in the compressor. They want the power supply for No. 1 put in. We are asking Moscow lots of questions-like "where" the oil is going. Apparently ground telemetry indicated this was developing for a while. We ask why no words were ever mentioned in the 8 O'Clock reports on this. We had a lot of work and testing with the airconditioning units with 4A docked and it really torpedoed our timeline. We don't want to enter into more of this lightly. We ask what is moved off the timeline tomorrow to make room for the 4-5 hours of IFM work on the power supply-but we don't get a clear answer on that one.

We shoot one IMAX scene after dinner. We are probably going to finish 1 interior roll before 5A.1 arrival. We'll have to see how it holds up as far as fogging.

SHIP'S LOG 02 MAR

Up early. We were working late last night with the PCS configuration "patches", and wrestling with the UNIX commands. Laptops were reloaded and left shut down while other files were uploaded to the MDM's. The word from Houston this a.m. is to wait another rev to connect the first laptop so that we're sure the changes to the C&C computers are complete.

Moscow says we can lay off the "Shumomer" ops for today. (3 hours scheduled). We are happy.

Yuri is missing 5 emails in his outlook "Send" folder. He drafted these up last night, and they were left in his Outbox. They should be showing in his "Send" folder, but they're not there, and Outbox is empty. We think an old mail (ost) file was uplinked and overwrote what Yuri did. We call Houston to see if the outgoing files can be recovered. Houston puts this in work.

Sergei and Yuri start the morning organizing the page changes for the Russian data file. This is scheduled for an hour, but takes closer to 3. The Russian books desperately need markings on their binders so you can tell which book is which when they are stacked up.

Sergei and Yuri are working "Plasma Crystal" in parallel all a.m. The telescience terminal is set up aft of the Central Post, stbd side. It is flat on the bulkhead, keyboard and screen facing forward. It's a big piece of equipment and it seems an awkward orientation, but it's a compromise. At least the PAO pictures will be interesting. Our ability to properly locate the computer and chassis has been severely restricted by the short power cord. We don't have any other choices here. Sergei and Yuri work a vacuum valve set-up problem for a while and finally get the internal chamber to go to complete vacuum. We get a few words in with some of the science team in Moscow. Data takes start tomorrow, and we should be sending some images down of what is going on.

Shep starts the day with a review of the 5A.1 mission plan. After a "go" from Houston, we finish the PCS display checkouts and load the new software on the 2nd PCS in the SM. Backup PCS machines 6023 and 6024 are also loaded with the 5A.060.P1 software. The keyboard work goes much more smoothly than last night, but we still think most of this work could be done with the File Manager application available on the Sun OS.

Everyone gets a workout in on the TVIS and the IRED. TVIS is continuing to operate normally. Cap screws on the front stabilizer boxes were tightened today as requested. Scraping on the fwd IRED canister is about the same-intermittent and at all load settings. We are thinking there is something inside the canister which is shifting around. The resistance for the can is somewhat decreased, especially in its lower ranges. The IRED is still functioning and we want to keep using it.

We do the private medical conferences (PMC's) on S-Band. The comm. is considerably better on our end than the OCA links we have had before. We recommend keeping this configuration. We should also test the OCA video/Sband voice just to see how this works.

We are continuing to unload the Progress at a steady pace. Keeping track of everything with the database is key, and we don't want to do this in a big hurry.

We finish the day with chow and "Hurricane". The DVD players are awesome. Thanks again, guys!

Unload Progress, Plasma Crystal, and work on PMA 3 day. Yuri and Sergei are configuring the experiment can in the ??? with its vacuum and electrical connections. We finally locate it on the nadir hatch, and it's not completely clear of the passageway, but close.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 22 lines]

Sergei and Yuri are doing the "plasma crystal" rigging and wiring off and on for the rest of the morning. We are to start the evacuation of the experiment can a bit later.

We are getting more work done in the lab in between other jobs. Most of it is final rigging for the computers and peripherals. The plans never adequately timeline this stuff, as you have to think for a while where gear needs to be and sometimes this is the most time-consuming part. We used the radio LAN for a while to carry the whole network but it is just too slow. It will not support adequate data transfers for IMS or other large files like picture downloads. So for right now, we have an ethernet line between the Node and Lab.

The RF access point (#1) is mounted in the aft hatchway of the lab. Square antenna is pointing in the nadir direction. We know this is not what ground wants, but the entire station is accessible on the RF net through this gateway. You can even be down in the Soyuz with your laptop and still stay on line. Putting this on the forward bulkhead as requested is just not suitable the way the lab is laid out right now.

We all get our exercise on the treadmill and in the "sport-zall". TVIS maintenance checks were performed 2 days ago. Results were OK-no new chafing or other damage. Box temp was 92.6 and electric motor temp was 90.32.


We eat some dinner and watch about 40 min of "Hurricane". Then everybody gets back to work. Sergei and Yuri are shooting a tape to be downlinked on the Russian "biosphere" experiment, and then unloading more Progress gear.

SHIP'S LOG 24-25 FEB (Late Entry)

24 FEB

0030 We are getting up and moving about after a short night. Yuri's bunked on the SM port bulkhead in the small diameter of the module. We have the hatch to the ??? closed so the living volume is the smallest we have had to put up with since we docked the Soyuz. We made a request to leave the ??? hatch open, as we had configured a number of things in there for "plasma crystal" which need to be changed back, but ??? turned us down. We moved the file server back into the FGB so we can get at messages, world map, etc. Mail has been cut off for a while as the OCA machine has been unhooked and put in the FGB. Anyway, going through the vehicle and closing all the hatches was a good exercise in how we might deal with a slow cabin leak situation, where we want to avoid damaging wire runs, etc. and we have an hour or so to close things up.

We start into the systems on SM, shutting everything off. This goes quickly, as Sergei and Yuri have done this lots before on Mir. We save ??? for last, and we'll probably turn that on first when we get back aboard. We set up the comm., although we are not completely certain that the configuration is going to perform based on the testing the last two days. We put some chow and the DVD player in the Soyuz and close the hatch about 0530.

It takes 2 orbits to get the first set of hooks off and the docking tunnel pressure checked. We get the "Austin Powers" sequel in while all this is taking place. (Maybe a Soyuz first here). We are down in the ?????????? ??????? and Shep has definitely forgotten how small the couches are. We finally are ready to do the second set of hooks and undock just after 1000. Comm is through Sband link now and we aren't getting voice up from Moscow. Yuri broadcasts in the blind anyway. We come off the docking adapter pretty briskly, and we are moving straight aft. It's kind of surprising how little rotation we have picked up in the separation. We drift out to 30 meters or so and Yuri starts flying manually. We have a timeline where ??? wants us to be based on comm. coverage and lighting, but we are not real happy that there seems to be no real loss of comm. plan once we are off. We had asked about this, but were told that we should just "sit tight" till we come back into radio contact. We pick up Moscow the radio. Yuri does his usual great job flying us around and we make a short trip up the underside of the station. Visibility, lighting, target contrast are all OK. Then we get to hang out for the final approach. Moscow gives the go, and we are moving in. About 3 meters out, we get a "wait" call as the TV picture on the ground is suddenly bad. Nobody's very happy about this-it's a bad place for a "wait-out". Fortunately, Moscow comes back quickly and gives us a go.

We make contact-it's a moderate bump with the docking mechanism. Then the docking program starts working to tighten everything up. Then a second set of hooks from FGB, and pressure checks. More DVD. We have a good seal, and we equalize the docking tunnel, and then to the station.

1320 We're opening up the FGB nadir hatch, and we start equalizing and opening the other hatches onboard. Sergei queries the ground about the FGB- ??? equalization valve, and we get the word that it's open. Sergei cracks the hatch and it pops off and cruises into the compartment pretty smartly. (it weighs maybe 60 kilos). Ears are popping and dust is flying. We guess we had a few extra mm. in the Soyuz. The lab software is not happy and we get Dp/Dt messages, along with some other warnings that appear unrelated.

We're back inside the station and it does seem good to get back "home". Everything is as we left it, and now we get to turn everything back on again, and re-rig all the hatches and cabling. The station air temperature has dropped maybe 5-8 degrees F, and is noticeably cool. We figure this is what happens when you turn all the electrical loads off. Powering everything back up takes the rest of the afternoon, and by early p.m., we are all ready to call it a day.

25 FEB

Sunday. Sergei and Yuri are getting ready for TORU refresher training. Shep is in the lab working on the rest of the SSC reconfiguration. We get the server moved back to the lab, and the RF access points set up and talking. Just as a test, we take a laptop into the SM and it is still staying on the radio network. It is talking to the access point in the Node through all the hatchways. Radio LAN speed is pretty slow, though. The mobile laptop is reading about 15K bits/sec, which is way under what we have on the Ethernet. Other SSC's on the net (fixed) are reading 30K over the radio LAN "bridge". We plan on making a comprehensive test of the network speed soon.

We have the afternoon set aside for TVIS repair. We had tried to change out 2 broken slats last week, but we were not happy with the belt configuration and how it ran. Ground uplinked an additional procedure which requires pulling the TVIS out of its pit and freeing up the belt to work on its underside. We start into this and the work goes fairly smoothly. We pull the treadmill out and loosen the belt tensioners. After moving the belt around a bit, we recover the one lost rivnut. It is "swaged" on the top, with part of the screw broken off inside of it. At first, we don't understand why this happened, but this becomes clear after we notice that the washers on the treadmill slats have interior holes with 2 slightly different sizes. We did not have any heads up on this. The small washers definitely hang up on the shaft of the rivnut. (picture of this sent down in the Checs folder Mon. night).
We straighten out the other bent rivnuts and assemble everything per procedure. We have some clean up steps to perform but we decide these can wait till Monday. We knock off at about 1900 to eat and enjoy the rest of the weekend, although the planners have promised us a light Monday and Tues. (We'll see).

SHIP'S LOG 22 FEB


The day really gets off to a bad start. The server connection to the net is down hard. We worked on it last night until 0100 and could not bring it up. We were doing the file server part of network reconfiguration yesterday. This moved the FS to the lab-we also extended the Ethernet lan from the Node into the lab (not part of the procedure). This allowed the server to rejoin the network without delay, rather than waiting much later when the RF access points are set up. The plan was working well, and the server was online from mid afternoon. At about 2200, we were reconfiguring some mail files which, with a lot of help from Windows NT, got put in the wrong place during the backup procedure. When we finished restoring the files, the network was down and would not come back up. We worked this for several hours. Finally, jiggling some cables brings just a part of the net back. (that really instills confidence in the stability of your network).

So as of 0700, we have to use the OCA machine for daily planning. Fortunately, ground has uplinked everything to the OCA's directories, so at least we have what we need onboard. But when we try and print, the printer locks up. It is not happy with the net now either. So Shep and Sergei start trying to figure out what is going on. After trying lots of other computer tricks that don't work, we put another network card in the server and that seems to fix the server problem. We power cycle the printer and that comes back. We are having a hard time understanding the how and why, but everything is working.

Yuri and Sergei are configuring for the Soyuz comm. checks, with Sband patched in. We have minimally readable comm., with some echo. We are getting good reception with Sband patched into the Russian intercom system, but apparently Houston is still reading us with lots of echo. We have occasionally had other loops up which might be producing this problem, but there are other instances where our comm. config has been completely by the book and we still have problems. ( hey-we are writing the book!)

Shep does the checks in the lab for NH3 in the fluid loops. Readings are essentially unchanged from a week ago--nominal. The ammonia sample bag is still a mess to deal with-there is just no way to do this without loose fluid drops.

Shep gets on the TVIS to see how bad the loose slat is that Sergei noticed last night. We had put in 2 new slats and torqued them down hard. One of the screws from the replacement slat is gone, and Shep puts a new screw in the hole and it just turns. Looking more closely, the rivnut which catches the screw is completely out of the belt. We take off the back cover for the TVIS and turn the belt by hand. Everything seems useable. Shep turns the treadmill on, and walks unpowered. Belt is still OK. With moderate speed, the belt is still happy, but we have a clicking noise on the forward belt cover. On closer inspection, we have another tread which is bowed up and is hitting the cover as it passes under. We think this tread may be cracked on the underside, and is flexing more than anticipated. We talk to Houston about taking off the front cover as well.

Right after lunch, we tag up with Exp-2 on the OCA. Comm is minimally adequate-we can get the main points across if everyone speaks slowly. We try and warn out the next crew that we think the docked period will be very busy, based on our 4A and 5A experiences.

Yuri and Sergei are going over the undocking details. ??? sends up a really nice set of computer graphics to help Yuri get oriented as to the station views he will see.

We get a session in on the IRED before the end of the workday. We do the cable and gear inspection, and all looks normal. The forward canister is still scraping its cable thimble. It sounds like light mechanical contact. We have taken this apart 5 times now to reset it, most recently Monday, and it is still unhappy. We are going to let the pieces fight it out.

Shep has a good Ham Radio school contact with Merivale School, in Ottawa. We get about 15 excellent questions--this is a very worthwhile activity for station crews.

At the end of the day we talk with TVIS engineers about the problems so far. We are no go for treadmill ops for a while. We have shot several digital pictures of the broken belt slats and the other ones that look suspect and they are in the OCA down\DCS folder tonight. We are not looking forward to field-stripping the TVIS, but we have a feeling that one is coming. Just not tomorrow, please.

Last thing today is the FPP hookup, which is still having trouble connecting with the NCU. We restart this several times with no joy. The SSC is talking to the NCU, but the data downloads won't start coming in.

We could really use some more power sockets in the Node. Especially for 5A.1 ops, where we will have an SSC, access point, CBCS, IMAX, FPP, and maybe bar code reader (if we ever get that working) all looking for electricity. Getting our hands on another UOP will be most welcome.

0700 We are getting up-Shep heads right for the coffee locker, but Yuri and Sergei have a small blood draw first thing after wakeup. After that, it is a set up for "?????" which is Russian for octopus, because that's what you look like with electrodes all over your body. We get words from Houston that we are to stand down on the TVIS for the day-our exercise periods have turned into an IFM to change out 2 broken slats on the treadmill.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 5 lines]

Shep starts on the TVIS IFM, as the procedure looks easy and we only have to take off 6 screws. Plus we want to get our exercise in. Pulling up the cover is not all that straightforward. The instructions omit any mention of 2 screws which tie in to the back of the cover through a blind "sleeve". These have to come off so the cover can be pulled up. The slats come off readily, and both are cracked completely through. 2 washers are missing from the underside of the slats. Putting on the new slats is not simple. The nuts backing the screws are "rivnuts" and most of these are spinning freely in their holes on the treadmill belt. So getting them to thread up is very difficult. Shep and Sergei finally manage to put on both slats and get them torqued down. Lots of little hardware problems. The new screws with the thread lock won't work, as they have too much friction with the rivnut and we can't keep the rivnut from turning with the screw. So we use the old ones. Now we test the belt, and the new slats are sticking up maybe .010" from the rest of the belt surface. And the rubbing with the back cover is unacceptable. So we pry up the cover to provide more clearance between it and the belt. We get on the TVIS and do a run and everything looks OK.

Shep and Sergei joke about "Bayes' Theorem", which roughly states that knowing that 2 slats out of maybe 150 have failed in 115 days, one should be able to calculate the probability that another will fail in the next 3 weeks-what are the odds?

We get a late start on the network reconfiguration. We did manage some get ahead tasks yesterday, so we are hoping that everything will level out by mid afternoon. The PCS and SSC are already set up in the Lab, and the file server has an Ethernet leg and power ready to go. We put the server in the Lab and power it up, and it is running fine-it is still logically on the same network as before when it lived in FGB. Then we start the real guts of the reconfiguration-setting up the expansion chassis and backing up the server. The work goes slow-we are still seeing very inconsistent performance from the "Ghost" software for imaging disks. We spend almost all afternoon on this and we work it until early p.m. We finally get the server reconfigured with its new load, but we do not get to the RF Lan set up steps. We leave the server on the Ethernet hardline for the time being.

Yuri gets more "shumomer" acoustic readings. This is way past our next most fun thing to do now.

Mid afternoon, we do an OCA media event and a spot for the Houston Rodeo. The OCA is reverting to its previous mischief, where we are simplex comm. Everytime we want to hear or speak, we have to toggle a button on the keyboard to switch this. We think this has got to be a software problem. Sergei comes up with a temporary fix where we swap the headset and speaker jacks, which gets us through the session today. Unfortunately, comm. on the uplink from the media rep was intermittently unreadable.

Sergei gets on the treadmill and quickly answers our earlier question about Bayes. Probability 100%--as we have another slat with a crack in it. We think the best thing to do here is just keep running on TVIS and see what happens.

We finish up the LAN work and call it a day. Movie tonight is the last ½ of "Frequency"-sort of a chick-flick, but it does get better at the end.

We are back to the usual 0630 get up. The monthly med-ops leg-check and mass-measurement "pogo-ops". After breakfast, Sergei and Yuri start configuring the ??? for "Plasma-Crystal", a science experiment that will live in there for a while. Shep does the periodic maintenance on the CSA-CP combustion products analyzer-prime and backup unit all nominal.

TVIS is still hanging in there. We all run on it today and we do the periodic maintenance checks. The good news-- bungees are doing well-TVIS is more stable at all speeds than before we put them on. We have noted a "clacking" noise for several days, and we finally pin it down to 2 cracked treads in the belt. They are right together, about 5 inches in from the right edge of the belt. The crack goes across each tread, leaving 2 individual pieces. The break is allowing the pieces to ride up a bit, and the occasional "clack" is the piece rubbing the rear enclosure of the treadmill. TVIS temperatures are normal-electric box-88.5, motor temp 90.7. The check of the SLD cables shows that the plastic sheathing on the "left" cable has a minor split in it. The metal cable is intact. See below for more data on TVIS wires requested earlier.

We all review the emergency "red books" for part of the morning and the afternoon. This is a good exercise-but we do need a cleaner transition as to when we should put down the "old" red books and pick up the new ones.

We take most of the FGB interior stowage pictures as requested. However, we need to reshoot several of these, as we have too much slave flash in what we thought was going to be dark enclosures.

Finished the day with some more exercise. Shep took the forward IRED canister apart one more time to reset the cord and reduce the internal scraping. We notice some improvement, but it is still making noise.

We have some dinner and watch part of "Frequency" (strange movie, although not as strange as "Usual Suspects" which we saw last night).

2230-Secured the SSC in the lab and set up FPP in the Node. Looking forward to tomorrow when we don't have to move SSC machines anymore to do this.

President's Day. ??????? ????. We need it. Thinking a lot about how to organize the lab. We are waiting on the "big picture" logistics plan for 5A.1 so we can put stuff away now and not have to move it again. We are also interested in whether the MPLM is going to be "combat loaded" so that gear can move right into stowage locations without a lot of sorting onboard.

We keep initiating radio contacts with Moscow using callsign "Alpha" but we only get " ???" back as a response. Wondering if there is a message here.

We are exploring the comm loop set ups. Any time panel 2 or 3 are "active" in SM, and RSA 2 or 1 are in a public call with GND 3 or 4, then voice from SM is going out S Band ( and maybe VHF as well). We are apparently "hot mike" if the ICOM (???) is pushed. We're not sure what is happening when button "1" is pushed-whether we are powering a transmitter or not. We would like to have a way to listen for Sband calls in SM and respond PTT. A simple diagram would sure go a long way here.

We notice today that the deck and overhead racks in the Node are oriented 180 degrees out from how they are arranged in the lab. We saw this a long time ago on a training drawing and thought this was a drafting error. Our apologies to DT for the comments on this-drawings were correct. We can't figure out if this should be an SPN or a "Crew Squawk"? Maybe those Shuttle guys just hooked up the lab backwards.

We have been receiving CD ROM's from the ground via Shuttle which have been difficult to read. We've had problems with both operational software and entertainment discs. These occasionally have some foreign material on the surface which gets in the way of the disk reader hardware. The new Russian laptop software image was the most significant example. We think there is some glue residue left on the disks from sticky notes or labels.

We are most certainly enjoying the DVD players-they are great! We are ready for movie night with the ground! A big "Alpha" thanks to all the folks who worked this-Hiep/Maury/Judy/Carol/Sue/Keith/Steve/Gabrielle + Karl King and Scott Stubbs.

Sergei cranks up two excellent software apps that came up on 5A. The first is a very detailed "World Map" which runs on Russian laptop 3. Detail on the map is down to the "Webster TX" level. The second app is outstanding even by Russian standards-a combined bird's eye view, world map, and star field which runs on the Russian PCS. It also reads state vector and attitude quaternion updates directly on the bus. Very slick. (Now if we could get a couple of large format LCD screens to hang in the front of the Central Post, we could give "Enterprise" a run).

Early evening, we fly right on top of X68 as Atlantis is waving off. We can see straight down on both pads and the SLF-looks inviting. We are looking forward to seeing that close up.

We are up and getting recalibrated as to what we are doing for the day. We see the server hung up, and reboot. The OSTPV does not seem to have a file for today. We talk to Houston and the correct file was thought to be onboard, but ground suspects the KFX file transfer had problems. Houston resends.

We give ground the bad news on the PMA 3 CPA panel. We noted sometime during the last part of gear transfer that one of the electrical connector stubs (on CPA 3 we think) is snapped off at the base. The connector is loose, and the metal sleeves for the individual wiring are visible inside the break.

More bad news-we have also noticed that the wires which ride up and down between the isolator "bars" and the TVIS platform are breaking. All the top sets of wires are broken-on all 4 corners. Other sets on the bars are damaged or broken as well. Each bar presently has 2 functional pairs of wire attachments. We are sending digital pictures down tonight.
We do more of the Lab setups today-condensate "T" installation and the Node filter replacement. We spend the rest of the day cleaning up the wiring and rigging in the Lab. Wire trays are going to prove very handy. We have put down 3 sections so far. We have the PCS and SSC 3 now located on rack panel S6-they are handy to the ATU, and the rack surfaces are easier to work around. We could do a bit better location job if we had some more run on the 1553 data line for the PCS.

We finish the day with IMAX cleaning and we get 2 shots in the lab done. Both are gear transfer scenes with the "Orlan" and some camera moves. (F 5.6, 40mm lens-we promise we will use the other ones).

A big thanks from us to the ECLSS team for the help in the lab-particularly on the AR rack. Keeping the info coming as fast as we asked for it was very motivating. Ready to do it again.

SHIP'S LOG 12 FEB

Monday started out a normal day. Yuri and Shep take out the capture latches from the Node vestibule and tie off all the electrical connectors. We install the closeout cover around the sides of the vestibule. We are waiting to close out the overhead, as we still have the Sband jumper interference problem. We note the closeout cover is hemmed backwards.

Sergei is working for most of the day with the Russian laptop software reloads and checks of central post computer 1.

We continue the lab setup from Sunday. The main task is to activate the AR rack, with all the CO2 and contaminant removal equipment. We spend some time hunting for the "condensate T" which we finally find at the bottom of a CTB. Rigging the umbilicals to the AR rack proves far from easy.

In the middle of the 2nd EVA, we catch Beemer and Tom outside the lab window. Sergei does his usual IMAX magic and we think we have the shot in the can. Lab window, EVA crew, sunrise-it doesn't get much better.

We have to slice the foam off of the LTL "T" sample valve just to get enough clearance to put it on. Even so, it has a very tight fit with part of the rack structure, and will go on only one way. None of the larger lines are "fairlead"-which is to say free of sharp bends or interference with other connections. We float the AR rack "up" out of its fittings, and take off all the umbilical support structure. This frees all the lines up considerably. (all not part of the procedure).

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 4 lines]

We take a break about midnight for some chow. Houston calls --the Sband IFM message is onboard, and MPEG movies for the procedure will come up overnight. We peruse the message over some chicken fajitas and decide we can do it now. (We are very ready for some better comm.) We clear the decks, break out the large vise-grips, and about 15 minutes later, the connector is clocked correctly and installed. We parley with Houston for some email, which we haven't seen for a day and a half.

Back to the AR rack in the Lab--we are supposed to insulate the LTL "T" connector, but all the insulation got used the day before on the IMV valve job. We "milk" the rubber insulation sleve down enough and tape it down. It'll have to do. Putting on the thermal mitten on the water lines is a significant battle. Shep and Sergei work this one item for 1 ½ hours, moving things and trying to get it over the connectors without destroying something. We finally put it up and get it latched. We are still not real happy with the fit, but it is on. Houston brings up the comm. in the lab, and we are very glad that the IFM is OK , and the ATU's really work.

We wrestle the MCA vacuum jumper in place, which is a 25' armored line about 3" in diameter. It takes a "come along" line to get the hose up to the couplings, as the jumper is so rigid. We finally get this mated around 0230 and the next job is to open a vacuum valve to the MCA. The procedure has a callout for the "utility door". Of course, there's no marking on the ARS rack which says this. We even have a cue card on the rack face (these are great, by the way), and this does not indicate which door we need to open either. We start taking the launch bolts off all the doors to hunt around. In the process, one of the washers floats down inside the rack-we can't retrieve it because our hands are full of the other 40 non-captive fasteners we just took off.

0300-We talk to Houston and tell them we have a lost washer in the rack. Houston is discussing unhooking everything we just made up, as nobody's sure the washer won't get into something critical. We are determined not to lose the day's work, and we are hunting the entire lab for the washer. No joy. We pop the rack out of its fittings and shake it to bring the washer up. This also does not work. We finally inventory every loose launch fastener in the lab, and we are still short one washer. We finally get the word around 0430 that ground has decided the filtration screens in the rack systems will block the washer, and we call it a night.

SHIP'S LOG

1100. Lab ingress. We have been waiting a long time for this day. Moscow's on the VHF with some comments about the central post computer work and software reloads. Russian laptop is still "offline" with no data. The US PCS won't come up and talk to the C&C MDM either. We switch over to Houston and get more words and updates on the day's plan. OCA has been reconnected to the early comm. system so we have the messages and mail onboard we have missed for the last day or so. We value email to the ground highly-even a day of not having it is disagreeable.

We try the few other computer tricks we know and the PCS won't come on line. The shuttle PCS is not up either. We are OK without computer comm for a while today, but doing the outfitting will certainly be less efficient without a handy computer.

We have spent a lot of time organizing books, tools, cables, ODF, computers, cameras, etc. in the Node. The module is a forest of wiring, bags, and gear. It's time equalize pressure in the vestibule and open the Node hatch to get ready for ingress. We visit with several Atlantis crew and coordinate a "go" time. We want to send TV down and we are also getting ready to shoot the first IMAX scene "as it happens". Don't know that we can get this "in" with all the things that are converging, but we are trying. With both UOP's offline in the Node, we are having to get real inventive to put power to the IMAX lights. We get late word to clean the camera-we don't have time to do it per procedure so we just hook up the vacuum cleaner and give the mechanism a shot.

It's go time for the hatch opening. Taco hands Shep the DD 250 for the "end user". We are honored to sign--just hope the bill does not come with it. Sergei's cranking the IMAX, goggles down, and we're all going in. The lab is well lit, very spacious, and clean. (probably the last time we'll be able to say that). We spend several minutes just looking around our new home. Even with many racks yet to be plugged in, the lab is a very impressive piece of hardware.

Marsha and Taco start orchestrating all the outfitting tasks. We are all feeling very pressed for time, particularly with the computer problems. Exp-1 was trained on some of the activities months ago, but having the Shuttle crew right on top of how to do everything is a big help.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 3 lines]

We still can't get a PCS connection in the SM, so we consider if a laptop can talk to the MDM's from the lab. This is not scheduled for today, but we put all the hardware pieces together, with some IMS help from the ground, and plug a laptop in the lab. We don't have time to dig for a procedure, and once again, we use the training drawings to figure out which UOP and bus to be on. We start the laptop-we are in. We also have SSC 3 dragged in from the Node to provide OSTP and MPV support. The lab's mini-"central post" is operational. The desktops, bogen brackets, and ethernet goodies that Atlantis brought prove to be essential items.

Everyone is climbing over racks and closeouts. Marsha is keeping all the action pointed in the right direction-Shep and Yuri chasing tools and parts and passing bags, Taco pulling out plumbing, Sergei, Beamer, and Roman working in the endcone on ducts and valves. Tom on the videocam. All is very much like the SEAL saying-- "two shooting, two looting, and one taking pictures."

Yuri does an exceptional job finishing off the IMV valve installation and insulation job. We think he's ready for his air-conditioning license. Of course, he had a lot of practice with ???-2 and the thermal cover.

We are working through the day on hardcopy data file, which is the way to go for this type of work, but with so many hands, we don't have enough copies to keep up. Shep can't find some of the procedures in MPV, and we learn later that we need to reload a new MPV set for the new material. Somehow we missed this word. The numbering system on the procedures is a big help in identifying exactly which procedure is of interest, but we wish the numbers were somehow unique-we have procedures in different systems groups with the identical numerical "coordinates".

We note today there are several disconnects between Form 24 and OSTPV. Mid day chow times for all of us do not agree. Actually, we think the Russian plan is a little more realistic-the OSTPV has us "turning to" for a good 7 hours before we get a break for lunch. We do not get the exercise periods in for the day-we can not do the lab work and take time for it. Everyone missed a period yesterday-for the same reason.

Impact driver gets a workout today. Unbolting, rotating and installing the ARS rack reveals some significant hardware problems. Mounting the K-bars, one of the holes and threaded inserts in the boss on top of the rack looks to be misdrilled. (We put calipers on this). Again, having drawings in hand on the rack fittings is invaluable. There were some other fittings and launch closeouts that we wrestled with. Sergei put the wrenches to one in particular that was preventing the ARS rack from laying down. We are getting good at figuring out alternate ways to do things, again, having had lots of practice on the SM and FGB.
At the end of the day, we have a large chunk of the lab setup complete.

We get a roll of IMAX shot in the midst of the day's work. 2 scenes on the hatch open, and 2 with the rack relocation. We are happy with the lighting and all the camera details. All exposures are f 5.6 or ½ stop higher.

We can't say enough about the good work of the Atlantis crew--They came, they saw, they installed. All in all, it was a landmark day for the station. We now have what looks to be at least 40 meters of open hatchway from the SM wardroom to the front of the lab.

SHIP'S LOG 08 FEB

We get to sleep in as part of our shifting for the 5A mission. Everyone's up around 0930, with our first call to Moscow an hour later. Some last minute preparations for the undocking, arranging cameras, opening up the large deck window. We are pitched down what looks to be about 40-45 degrees. We have a great view aft with the horizon across the viewfield. Yuri is setting up the docking TV.

1130 Progress undock. The cargo ship moves away below us-it's quick compared to a Shuttle departure. We can see the outline of the spacecraft--the spotlight is pretty bright. Even though it is a night pass over Russia, the snow and cloud cover make the Earth background very visible. It looks a lot like twilight although we are well past the terminator. The engine pulse on Progress is also very visible and vehicle starts a slow rotation as well. We're observing thru the large deck window. We try to get some video images on the camcorder but the light level is very low. The Progress moves below and a little bit forward on us. It is just a black speck now against the cloud cover. The only way we can pick it up is that it does not appear to move with the cloud cover. Sergei is using the laser rangefinder to get some trajectory data on the departure.

Houston gives us a heads-up on a Caution and Warning tone on PCS that we did not clear.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 2 lines]

We get an early start on unloading PMA 3. We do this methodically, with everything moved in the database as well. If we broke down the time we spent on this today, it would be about 30 minutes moving and securing all the items, and about 2 1/2 hours working with the IMS database to make sure everything was "fixed".

Yuri and Sergei do some more troubleshooting on the -Y Kurs radar set. The medical locker is swung out of the way. The scopemeter shows an open circuit on one of the test connections. This could be the problem experienced Monday.

We ask Houston for more of the big picture for FPP ops during the 5A docked period. With only 1 UOP and lots of power users, we need to have a lot of flexibility as to what gets plugged in. IMAX takes a lot of connections for shoots in the Node (4 lights and an audio battery charger), We discuss turning FPP off during the day, and just running it at night. This is a very workable solution for us.
We spend the rest of the day cleaning up the Node and the rest of Alpha. The IMAX gear is all out, batteries OK, camera tests OK. Waiting on some film.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 13 lines]


We finish the day with some exercise, chow, and the last of the movies we have not seen yet. Tonight's selection-- "History of Navy SEALS". We think this is very appropriate, as we will probably soon have a use for the quote: "the only easy day was yesterday."

SHIP'S LOG 07 FEB

100th Day. We have been talking with the Capcoms about making this a station tradition- observance of an expedition's 100th day in orbit. Of course, a lab module surrounded by a shuttle all going Mach 25 would be a good start.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 11 lines]

The Wiener comes "up" this a.m. with a blank screen, although it is still processing and "routing". Sergei reboots it and it runs normally.

We spend the day packing up the last of the gear and putting it into Progress. The last bag of clothes, the last ??? and ???'s are put inside. All the foam packing left over that we can find is in as well. (Cutting up some of the large blocks of foam was interesting). We manage to put all the non-collapsible food containers in as well. We can see the entire FGB deck now. (Haven't had this cleared off for months.)

A lot of additional time today is spent just squaring things away, putting stuff in the right stowage location, and getting ready for docked ops. The Node is looking clean as well, although this won't last long when we start rigging IMAX equipment and destowing PMA 3.

We secure the FGB hatch and start the pressure integrity checks on Progress. It looks to be tight. Moscow goes over the undocking details for tomorrow.


??? and ??? "lane" changes commanded by the ground are transparent to us-no alarms received onboard. We talk to Glavni about the predocking plan to reconfigure computers for redundancy.

All hands get a workout in on the TVIS and the IRED. Both are functioning normally.

We get some chow and rig for movies. We watch "Full Metal Jacket". This has some of the finest "drill sergeant" scenes in moviedom. Good orientation for the next OCA pass with Houston. We observe "100th Night" with the flight control team, an ancient tradition at all the service academies. On the 100th night before graduation, the seniors and "plebes" (or "swabs", etc.) swap their "roles" for a short period. This is intended as a practical exercise in how leaders and those being led "see" each other. We talk with the team in Houston and exchange some words on the humorous and maybe less than memorable things we have done up here. We hope this will be a new addition to the growing list of station traditions. (We are also hearing rumors of patches). Thanks again to Flight and Capcom for fitting this in today.

We stay up for late news on the Atlantis launch. We have a good OCA tie in about 5 minutes after MECO. All hands are really glad we have the crew and the shuttle on the way to us. Great job by the launch and control teams.

SHIP'S LOG 06 FEB

0340 "This is your wake-up call." Same signature at the central post as last evening; a "Dp/Dt alarm". The manovacometer is stable, so we are pretty sure it's the same problem. We check some of the systems again, and things look OK. Shep and Sergei have their SSC's plugged into "UPS" sockets now, and the Weiner is still running, so we look at mail until the central computer restarts everything. We take a quick look at Elektron and it is running ok. The other systems are happy, and we decide to wait till the first a.m. call with Moscow to restart the CKB airconditioning unit.

First work for Sergei this a.m is more adventure with the "shumomer". Moscow is discussing taking noise data with SM panels open and then closed. We talk about how to fix the noise onboard and we would go after some of the bigger noisemakers first and worry about panel insulation later.

Shep is in the Node doing the last part of some wire run cleanups for the IWIS. We want them well out of the way so they can remain that way for a while. We're also putting together the shopping cart at the "tools-R-us" depot in the Node. The NiMH batteries are at full charge and power tools are in standby mode.

We are still having file transfer problems with OCA. The system looks fine on our end, and we have had good performance as recently as 2 days ago. We are reluctant to change out hardware. Houston tries several times to send up files without success. We finally receive today's Ops Summary through the Russian packet comm. system. (Major style points to the ground team for throwing the book out and going with what works.)

We are studying all the 5A material. Shep finally locates the CDH drawing with the Node MDM/bus reconfiguration details. He feels much better. A big thanks to the planners for making a slot in the timeline to do this.

Yuri and Sergei work on the Orlan comm. configuration from the ??? during several VHF passes today. We still don't have it working the way it should be-too much background noise.

Sergei and Yuri also get some work in on the Kurs connectors for the aft docking port. We are still testing this.

We change out the OCA chassis late afternoon and that seems to work some magic. OCA is back on line. We do have some kind of speaker-microphone configuration problem, but that may be a default we have to go reset.

Shep, Sergei and Yuri all work the RAMV measurements for about 25 minutes-it's one of the first times we have used the intercom system to pass word from the Node to the central post. We will probably be doing this a lot more with the lab attached. Data listed below.

We ate some dinner and watched the last part of "City of Angels". Shep did his best to explain to Yuri and Sergei what the phrase "chick flick" means.

SHIP'S LOG 05 FEB

0712 First comm. with Moscow. Apparently Houston's been having some trouble with the OCA file transfer. We already saw that mail and some of the execute package did not make it up. We already have the OCA reboot started when Houston asks. We are missing some operational messages, and we don't seem to have the .htm file which points to each day's execute package. We ask Houston about this too, and finally get it squared away a few hours later.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 18 lines]

We remove old OSTPV files as requested by Houston, and do a time sync and back up on the SSC file server.

FPP is checked several times and seems to be running fine all day. We have stayed off IMS in the Node just to keep the FPP happy today. But we have a feeling IMS " . . will be back."

TEPC data is recorded and put in the data section below. TEPC sensing unit is now relocated to inboard side of SM panel 438, just inside Sergei's cayuta.

Shep and Sergei work the CMG jumper removal and the TCS Quick Disconnect procedure. We are moving all the foam stowed on top of NOD D1 anyway, so it seems like a good time to do several things together. We call up OCA 1005, but there is nothing in the file there for CMG jumper removal. ( File size is 0 K). We take off the Node panel and remove the jumpers. Bus connectors are mated and everything looks correct. We shoot some closeout photos and put the panel back up. Squaring away the IMS details for the CMG gear would have added another 15-20 minutes to this task today, but we decided to wait until FPP ops are over.

Yuri is organizing the gear transfer and having some issues with OCA 918-which shows some revisions done this a.m. The new message should be marked 918A, or "B", etc. to show us it has been changed-but isn't. And it still says 20 non-collapsible food containers are to go down on shuttle We are going to put these in Progress based on last words from Capcom.

Working the TCS QD's; none of the fittings have the thermal mittens on them as shown in the pictures. Everything disconnected, bagged and taped according to the new procedure. The annotations are good and very clear. Our thanks to the folks who jumped on this. The Node panels are still very difficult to reinstall and fit up right-even with a couple of fasteners threaded up, many of the remaining ones fail to "find" their captive nuts. We noted that on the P1 panel, there is a lengthy 3 page fit up procedure "decal" which explains how to put the panel back on. Unfortunately, it's on the back side of the panel.

After lunch, we have a very good OCA contact with the JASON expedition. We get interactive contact with students in Hawaii, the US, and the UK during the 15 minute pass. We have been waiting a long time for this kind of educational broadcast from station-and now we are doing it.

TVIS checks performed. SLD's look fine, electric box temp is 92.0 and motor temp is 92.4. Yuri is very happy he has to do the TVIS fitness eval again, because the ground didn't get their telemetry Friday. (Thank you sir, may I please have another)

TEPC relocated. Forgot to do this earlier but it was moved about 1812. TEPC put just inside of aft edge of SM 437. Electronic unit is now on SM 448. TEPC power cycled to give a mark on the move time.

We have a warning light -failed smoke sensor(SM #6). We check the electrical communication of the sensor circuit a bit later, and that is working.

1944. Right during evening chow, we get the 2 red lights, tones, and all the fans shutting down-"Dp/Dt". This is our second set of red lights in the last hour. All hands to the central post to see what is up.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 12 lines]

We have a last comm. pass with Houston, and it is "reboot the OCA" again. We have been having great audio and video performance with OCA, but apparently the KFX file transfer is not happy. More work on this tomorrow.

SHIP'S LOG 02 FEB

0700 We are up and getting ready for Friday. We are also ready for the weekend. This may be the last relatively free one we have for a while.

First work today is to check out why ??? is showing bad "konservant" quality. Sergei and Shep look at the hardware, the mal procedure, and the drawings. After a few test cycles, the indication clears. We had run out of flush water last night, but this was refilled prior to this. Maybe some kind of transient flow problem. The indication has not reappeared. Gotta love those drawings.

Shep goes into the Node to restart SSC 3 and run some more FPP data takes. SSC 3 boots and loads service packs 5 and 6 without error, and FPP experiment looks nominal.

Yuri is working almost the entire a.m. on stowing gear in Progress and updating the IMS database. Almost every moveable object in SM with a bar code is now in the database.

Shep starts the Node ITCS quick-disconnect procedure in OCA 1048 with some help from Sergei. There's a fine picture in the procedure, but we can't access the place the arrows are pointing to without removing an additional panel, NOD 1S2-33. Then, when this panel is off, we are looking at permanent insulation surrounding the water lines and something is definitely amiss. We pull off the other panel called out, NOD 1 D2-14, and can see only "gamah" fittings and no identifying markings at all. We write up a quick note for Houston so ground can read about the problems as we are talking to Expedition 2 on OCA.

1315 We try to get OCA comm. with Exp 2 for about 20 minutes and we don't have a full 2-way link. Exp 2 is at the BME console, and we do have good comm. with the front room. So about 1340 or so, we do the crew tag up with the crew at the Capcom console. Comm is still lower quality than we are used to, but we are able to respond to all the questions. Apparently Yuri U has sent Yuri G. 4 emails recently which have not been received on this end.

After lunch, Shep downlads the CMG data. Everything looks normal with the CMG's. Data listed in the last section.

Sergei and Shep start the RAMV checkout procedure. The knob in the Node does not have numbered positions on it, so we make up the correct markings with black pen and tape and put these on. (We also noted today that numerous fire port decals in the Node are identified with panel numbers which are incorrect-they don't agree with the numbers of the panels they are on). Getting started with the RAMV procedure, Shep enables the valve and gets a failure indication right away. We wait to talk to Houston on this one also.

Yuri gets his monthly treadmill check on the TVIS with the Russian monitoring gear. TVIS is working OK.

We do a PAO contact with MSFC to open the Payload Ops Center for station. Voice quality is good, maybe a bit better than the usual OCA comm. with Houston. We are happy that we have some payload activity to talk about even before the center is in official operation.

We get some more words from Capcom regarding the Node quick disconnects-we are looking at the wrong lines (but we had a lot of help from the picture). Also, the panel access to the other set of QD's is behind a different panel than that called out. RAMV problem is a simple fix-we just did not have the RPC on before we started.

Shep goes back in the Node and disconnects the 2 QD's we can access, takes some closeout photos, and puts the paneling back in place. We are going to ask to pick up the rest of the procedure Mon. It involves moving a lot of gear on D1 panel, and we just did not have time for that today. We have all the excess foam and some other light trash stowed there for Progress. We didn't get to the rest of the RAMV job either, so we are requesting that be moved to early next week as well.

We get more word from the Capcoms late in the day that we should not plan on Shuttle taking down the 20 empty non-collapsible food containers. This is going to be OK with us, as we think all will fit in Progress. Thanks for the timely answer.

We finish the day in the "sport-zal" and catch the early showing of "Tombstone" in the wardroom.

SHIP'S LOG 01 FEB

IWIS day. After the initial comm. check and breakfast, we go through the ops summary and the 8 o' clock report. The "red" change text is a very useful addition. Yuri starts into the logistics work-he is getting his arms around everything for the 5A transfer-we have a number of questions on this which are listed at the end of the log.

Shep starts in the Node rigging the IWIS hardware. Moving the RSU to port works well with the cable runs. Everything is made up so it is out of the way as much as possible. Getting gear out of the IWIS bag is unwieldy, as there are lots of loose cables, pieces, and ziplock bags flying around. A packet floats out with EVA fresnel lenses in it-this definitely belongs somewhere else. We would prefer to see things packed so they can not float around so much once a bag is open.

Putting in the accelerometers goes slowly, particularly for the location behind the S4 closeout. The photo is not at all clear, and it takes maybe 20 minutes just to figure out exactly what the procedure is trying to explain. This is definitely the case where a single good sketch or simple drawing would be much better. We stick the forward accelerometer in place also, exactly as described in the procedure and photo, and realize after all the data takes that the X, Y, Z orientation markings on the sensor do not agree with the station global coordinates. X on the sensor is pointed in the minus Y direction on station. Please advise what is correct here.

Sergei and Yuri are loading more sound level meter data onto laptop 3. This is now becoming our really most favorite thing to do.

[REDACTED MATERIAL - 17 lines]

Sergei does the monthly physical test on the TVIS treadmill, using the Russian monitoring equipment.

2nd Harness cord changed out on IRED.

We copy the request from Houston on the timex watches. We will keep using the ones we have onboard-there are some workarounds we can apply that will help the limited "alarm" situation. We don't request any more watches be sent up on 5A, but thanks to all the crew equipment folks for asking. As a heads-up to Exp 2, any plans to use the timex download capability should include more laptop IR transmitters. We have 1 onboard, but more will be required if the next crew wants to fully use this capability.

Logistics questions for 5A ops (ref OCA 0918, page 2):

Items to prepare for transfer to STS on FD 9-

Item 5. Centerline Micrometeoroid Debris cover assembly
Question-are we to give the whole assembly to Shuttle, or just the stiffener rods? The "comments" make this confusing.

Item 7. We don't think we have any Humidity Condensate Sample bags, unless these have been stowed someplace we have missed. Can ground advise us where to look for these?

Item 8. We have only 2 Chemical Archive Bags.

Items to swap during 5A (page 3)-


We want to have absolute confirmation of item 12, Food Containers, (non collapsible), that Shuttle is ready to take 20 of these. This is quite a lot of volume to stow onboard.-We request this info ASAP.

NiMH batteries. We have 5.

PCS 3.0 GB Hard Drive (760 XD) 4A load (2). We have these. Would like to request we keep the drives onboard as spares to be loaded with other software as required.

SHIP'S LOG 18-19 MAR

We started this morning thinking that this was going to be a relaxed schedule, but the pace of the day keeps accelerating. The MPLM loading plan is coming together, and it looks like the changes to the cargo load are minimal. We are pretty surprised, however, when the laundry bags and dry trash bags get offloaded as we don't have enough " margin". The operational utility of the entire week with "Leonardo" could have been greatly increased if we had more flexibility how to put cargo in it. There are also many small details regarding outfitting which, if changed, would simplify the act of bringing the MPLM aboard and making it ready. Grounding straps is an example. In order to put the grounding straps on, two passive CBM guides have to be removed. Plus the straps have to be fitted up and bent to shape to line up the fasteners. The whole process takes at least 30 minutes. Some kind of jumper cable, such as a battery booster cable, which would just clamp to the metal fittings on both sides of the docking ring, would cut the time for this work to near zero. Isolating RACU/DDCU power cables, putting in IMV jumpers, dealing with the "O" rings are all activities which probably have more straightforward yet satisfactory solutions which would help us configure more quickly.
We get an IMAX scene in, showing the MPLM-Node-Lab area. We hope this one comes out well, as we had to use some inventive lighting techniques-we are anxious to see how they worked. We finally get the MPLM secured and egressed, and close the hatch. The deactivation, deoutfitting, etc. goes as planned. We are working quickly with no missteps and we are still unable to stay with the timeline. The Node hatch closure and vestibule leak check starts out well, but a vacuum leak in the hose slows everything down some more until the fittings are tightened. Finally the MPLM is moved away. We start settling down to the other tasks on our plate.

Sergei gets a run in on the TVIS, and it is making its clacking noise again. Yuri follows with a session, and a piece of slat breaks off and gets caught in the rear cover, and comes completely out of the tread. We take pictures and send them down. TVIS is out of commission until the long tread slat replacement procedure can be run.

We spent the rest of the day configuring DAUI's, doing the CBCS test, taking condensate samples, operating Chibis, shooting some more IMAX, and talking about more of the outstanding handover items. We think we even found some answers as to why the DZUS fasteners are hanging up----But it is time to leave these details to the next crew.

On the eve of Expedition One's departure from the station, we would like to thank the many individuals who have supported our mission-the fellow astronauts and cosmonauts who have flown up and assembled pieces of hardware, and the many hundreds--even thousands in the control centers on the ground who have made "Alpha" a reality. We will remember this time always as a most special episode in our lives and as a highlight of our space programs.

To this end, it is a tradition for the skipper of the first crew aboard a new vessel to designate those individuals who are to be considered "Plankowners":

All Astronauts, and Cosmonauts, who flew on Space Station Alpha for the purpose of building or operating the station; and all Flight Directors, Flight Controllers, and Operations Personnel who controlled Space Station "Alpha" in space, from the initial launch of Zarya Nov. 1998 until the end of the First Expedition 19 March 2001, are hereby designated as Space Station Alpha "Plankowners". All rights and privileges, such as are accorded by custom aboard naval ships, shall be conferred on said individuals.


Log entry to be made 19 March onboard "Alpha", as Expedition One is relieved by Expedition Two:


Change of command is an ancient naval tradition--the passage of responsibility for mission, welfare of crew, and integrity of vessel--from one individual to another.

Space Station Alpha has been commissioned in orbit. The service module has been activated. The power element and laboratory module have been brought aboard. A successful resupply mission with Discovery and her crew is complete. Station is at normal condition--all systems functional and ready to carry out operations

We are on a true space "ship" now, making her way above any Earthly boundary. We are not the first crew to board "Alpha", or the last to depart. But we have made "Alpha" come alive. We gave her a name, and put substance to the ideas -

That our crews can work together as equals--And our countries as partners.

That we may proceed with bolder and more enterprising voyages in space-with benefit from our differences, and with stronger purpose in our common goals.

We pass to your care "Alpha's" log--with the hope that many successful entries are recorded here---that explorations carried out onboard are prodigious, and discoveries wondrous. May the good will, spirit, and sense of "mission" we have enjoyed onboard--endure. Sail her well.
